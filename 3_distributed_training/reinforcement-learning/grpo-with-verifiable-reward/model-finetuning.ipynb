       "\"Question: A farmer has a total of 80 apples and oranges. If he has 30 apples, how many oranges does he have?\\nSolution: Let's think step by step. To determine the number of oranges, we subtract the number of apples from the total number of fruits. So, the number of oranges is 80 - 30 = 50.\\n#### The final answer is 50\\n\\nQuestion: Emily has 3 times as many pencils as Alice. If Alice has 15 pencils, how many pencils does Emily have?\\nSolution: Let's think step by step. To find out how many pencils Emily has, we multiply the number of pencils Alice has by 3. Alice has 15 pencils, so Emily has 15 * 3 = 45 pencils.\\n#### The final answer is 45\\n\\nQuestion: Samantha baked 40 cookies and wants to divide them equally into bags, with each bag containing 5 cookies. How many bags will Samantha need?\\nSolution: Let's think step by step. To find the number of bags needed, divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per bag. Thus, 40 divided by 5 equals 8.\\n#### The final answer is 8\\n\\nQuestion: Jack has collected 12 more marbles than Kevin. If Kevin has 27 marbles, how many marbles does Jack have?\\nSolution: Let's think step by step. To find how many marbles Jack has, we add 12 to the number of marbles Kevin has. So, Jack has 27 + 12 = 39 marbles.\\n#### The final answer is 39\\n\\nQuestion: Mark has $50 and buys a toy that costs $35. How much money does he have left?\\nSolution: Let's think step by step. To find out how much money Mark has left, subtract the cost of the toy from the total amount of money Mark has. So, $50 - $35 = $15.\\n#### The final answer is 15\\n\\nQuestion: There are 24 students in a classroom. If each group must have 4 students, how many groups can be formed?\\nSolution: Let's think step by step. To find how many groups can be formed, we divide the number of students by the number of students per group. So, 24 / 4 = 6 groups can be formed.\\n#### The final answer is 6\\n\\nQuestion: A pack of pencils costs $4. If you buy 7 packs, how much will you spend in total?\\nSolution: Let's think step by step. The total cost is found by multiplying the cost per pack by the number of packs. Hence, you spend 7 * $4 = $28.\\n#### The final answer is 28\\n\\nQuestion: A book has 240 pages, and Sarah reads 20 pages each day. How many days will it take her to finish the book?\\nSolution: Let's think step by step. Sarah reads 20 pages per day, so we divide the total pages by the number of pages she reads per day. Therefore, it takes her 240 / 20 = 12 days to finish the book.\\n#### The final answer is 12\\n\\nQuestion: Olaf collects colorful toy cars. At first, his collection consisted of 150 cars. His family, knowing his hobby, decided to give him some toy cars. Grandpa gave Olaf twice as many toy cars as the uncle. Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars, 5 less than Mum. Auntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars, 1 more than the uncle. How many toy cars does Olaf have in total, after receiving all these gifts?\\nSolution: Let's think step by step. \""

       "\"Question: A farmer has a total of 80 apples and oranges. If he has 30 apples, how many oranges does he have?\\nSolution: Let's think step by step. To determine the number of oranges, we subtract the number of apples from the total number of fruits. So, the number of oranges is 80 - 30 = 50.\\n#### The final answer is 50\\n\\nQuestion: Emily has 3 times as many pencils as Alice. If Alice has 15 pencils, how many pencils does Emily have?\\nSolution: Let's think step by step. To find out how many pencils Emily has, we multiply the number of pencils Alice has by 3. Alice has 15 pencils, so Emily has 15 * 3 = 45 pencils.\\n#### The final answer is 45\\n\\nQuestion: Samantha baked 40 cookies and wants to divide them equally into bags, with each bag containing 5 cookies. How many bags will Samantha need?\\nSolution: Let's think step by step. To find the number of bags needed, divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per bag. Thus, 40 divided by 5 equals 8.\\n#### The final answer is 8\\n\\nQuestion: Jack has collected 12 more marbles than Kevin. If Kevin has 27 marbles, how many marbles does Jack have?\\nSolution: Let's think step by step. To find how many marbles Jack has, we add 12 to the number of marbles Kevin has. So, Jack has 27 + 12 = 39 marbles.\\n#### The final answer is 39\\n\\nQuestion: Mark has $50 and buys a toy that costs $35. How much money does he have left?\\nSolution: Let's think step by step. To find out how much money Mark has left, subtract the cost of the toy from the total amount of money Mark has. So, $50 - $35 = $15.\\n#### The final answer is 15\\n\\nQuestion: There are 24 students in a classroom. If each group must have 4 students, how many groups can be formed?\\nSolution: Let's think step by step. To find how many groups can be formed, we divide the number of students by the number of students per group. So, 24 / 4 = 6 groups can be formed.\\n#### The final answer is 6\\n\\nQuestion: A pack of pencils costs $4. If you buy 7 packs, how much will you spend in total?\\nSolution: Let's think step by step. The total cost is found by multiplying the cost per pack by the number of packs. Hence, you spend 7 * $4 = $28.\\n#### The final answer is 28\\n\\nQuestion: A book has 240 pages, and Sarah reads 20 pages each day. How many days will it take her to finish the book?\\nSolution: Let's think step by step. Sarah reads 20 pages per day, so we divide the total pages by the number of pages she reads per day. Therefore, it takes her 240 / 20 = 12 days to finish the book.\\n#### The final answer is 12\\n\\nQuestion: Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11. If their total age now is 162, calculate Allen's age 10 years from now.\\nSolution: Let's think step by step. \""
