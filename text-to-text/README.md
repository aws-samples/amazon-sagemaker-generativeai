In this module, you will learn step-by-step how to perform NLU tasks using FLAN-T5-XL. Specifically, you will learn how to read and understand multi-turn customer support chat transcripts, and engineer prompts that enable FLAN-T5-XL to learn in-context and improve its performance in N-shot learning. This will enhance the model's ability to infer context and answer questions derived from the chat transcripts.

Overall, this module provides an excellent opportunity to explore the capabilities of FLAN-T5-XL in solving NLU tasks, such as text summarization, abstractive question answering, sentiment analysis, and sentiment phrase extraction.
