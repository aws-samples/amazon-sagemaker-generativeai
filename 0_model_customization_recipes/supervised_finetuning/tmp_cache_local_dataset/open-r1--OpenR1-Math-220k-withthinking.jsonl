According to the Pythagorean theorem, we then have\n\n$$\na^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}\n$$\n\nA square number can give a remainder of 0, 1, or 4 when divided by 5. If neither $a$ nor $b$ is divisible by 5, then the left side of (1) can give a remainder of 2 (in the form $1+1$), 0 (in the form $1+4$), or 3 (in the form $4+4$) when divided by 5. Since 2 and 3 cannot be the remainder of a square number $-c^{2}$ when divided by 5, and 0 is excluded by the condition, if the length of the hypotenuse is not divisible by 5, then the length of one of the legs will be divisible by 5.\n\nIf both legs are even, then their product is divisible by 4. We claim that this is also true if there is an odd leg.\n\nFirst, note that both legs cannot be odd. In this case, in (1), $a^{2}+b^{2}$ would be even, and thus $c^{2}$, as an even square number, would be divisible by 4, while $a^{2}$ and $b^{2}$, when divided by 4, would each give a remainder of 1, making their sum 2. In this case, however, equality could not hold in (1).\n\nIf now one of the legs, say $a$, is odd, then $b$ is even, and $c$ is odd. From (1),\n\n$$\nb^{2}=(c+a)(c-a)\n$$\n\nHere, both factors on the right side are even. If neither is divisible by 4, then they each give a remainder of 2 when divided by 4, so their sum, $2c$, is divisible by 4. This would, however, make $c$ even, which is not true.\n\nThus, in (2), the right side is also divisible by $2^{3}=8$. We know that a square number, in this case $b^{2}$, has every prime factor in its prime factorization with an even exponent. This means that $b^{2}$ is divisible by $2^{4}$, and thus $b$ is divisible by 4.\n\nThis proves that if (1) holds, then $ab$ is divisible by 4. The area of the triangle, $ab\/2$, is thus an even number. Since there is a leg divisible by 5, the area is also divisible by $2 \\cdot 5=10$, so the last digit of its measure is 0.\n\nRemark. The statement - that on the one hand, in every Pythagorean triple there is a number divisible by 5, and on the other hand, the product of the legs is divisible by 4 - can also be easily shown based on the known characterization of Pythagorean triples. According to this characterization, Pythagorean triples can be written in the form $a=k\\left(u^{2}-v^{2}\\right)$, $b=2 k \\cdot u v$, and $c=k\\left(u^{2}+v^{2}\\right)$, where $k$ is any natural number, and $u$ and $v$ are relatively prime numbers of different parities, with $u>v$.

The function $f(n)=n+2$ is suitable because its values are positive integers, and for any positive integer $n$,\n\n$$\nf(f(n))+f(n)=((n+2)+2)+(n+2)=2 n+6\n$$\n\nWe will show that there is no other solution.\n\nThe function $f$ is certainly injective, that is, if $n \\neq m$, then $f(n) \\neq f(m)$. Indeed, if $f(n)=f(m)$, then $f(f(n))=f(f(m))$ and $2 n+6=f(f(n))+f(n)=f(f(m))=f(m)=2 m+6$, from which it follows that $n=m$. The injectivity implies that if $n \\leq h$, then $f(n)=1, f(n)=2$ or $f(n) \\geq h$.\n\nNow we determine the value of $f(1)$. If we write (1) for $n=1$, we can establish an upper bound for $f(1)$:\n\n$$\nf(1)=8-f(f(1)) \\leq 8-1=7\n$$\n\nTo prove that $f(1)=3$, we need to exclude six cases.\n\nCase I: $f(1)=1$. Then $f(f(1))=1$ and $f(f(1))+f(1)=2 \\neq 2 \\cdot 1+6$.\n\nCase II: $f(1)=2$. Then\n\n$f(2)=f(f(1))=2 \\cdot 1+6-f(1)=6, f(6)=f(f(2))=2 \\cdot 2+6-f(2)=4, f(4)=f(f(6))=2 \\cdot 6+6-f(6)=14, f(14)=f(f$\n\nThis contradicts the fact that $f(14)$ is positive.\n\nSimilarly, starting with $f(1)=4,5,6$ and 7 leads to a contradiction, either a negative or a multi-valued function within at most three steps. (See the 1st Remark at the end of the problem.)\n\nFrom $f(1)=3$, it follows that for every odd $n$, $f(n)=n+2$. This is true for $n=1$, as we have seen. If for some $n$, $f(n)=n+2$, then $f(n+2)=f(f(n))=2 n+6-f(n)=2 n+6-(n+2)=n+4$.\n\nNow we determine the value of $f(2)$ as well. If we write (1) for $n=2$, we get that $f(2)=10-f(f(2)) \\leq 10-1=9$. It is also certain that $f(2)$ cannot be an odd number greater than 1, because the function takes these values at odd places, which would contradict the injectivity. The possible values of $f(2)$ are therefore 4, and 1, 2, 6, and 8. Now we exclude these:\n\nCase I: $f(2)=1$. Then $f(1)=f(f(2))=2 \\cdot 2+6-f(2)=9$, which contradicts $f(1)=3$.\n\nSimilarly, we reach a contradiction for $f(2)=2,6$ and 8.\n\nFrom $f(2)=4$, it again follows that for every even $n$, $f(n)=n+2$.\n\nII. solution. That $f(n)=n+2$ is suitable can be verified according to the previous solution.\n\nLet $n$ be any fixed positive integer. We will show that $f(n)=n+2$.\n\nDefine the following sequence: $a_{0}=n, a_{k+1}=f\\left(a_{k}\\right)$. The values of the function $f$ are positive integers, so this sequence consists of positive integers. Let $b_{k}=a_{k}-(n+2 k)$. By definition, $b_{0}=0$, and we want to show that $b_{1}$ is also 0.\n\nAccording to equation (1),\n\n$$\na_{k+2}+a_{k+1}=2 a_{k}+6\n$$\n\nfrom which\n\n$b_{k+2}+b_{k+1}=a_{k+2}-(n+2 k+4)+a_{k+1}-(n+2 k+2)=a_{k+2}+a_{k+1}-(2 n+4 k+6)=2 a_{k}+6-(2 n+4 k+6)=2\\left(a_{k}-(n\\right.$\n\nWe prove by induction that for any non-negative integer $k$,\n\n$$\nb_{k}=\\frac{1-(-2)^{k}}{3} b_{1}\n$$\n\nThis is true for $k=0$ and $k=1$, because the equations $b_{0}=0 \\cdot b_{1}=0$ and $b_{1}=b_{1}$ hold. If (3) holds for $k=m$ and $k=m+1$, then it also holds for $k=m+2$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& b_{m+2}=2 b_{m}-b_{m+1}=2 \\frac{1-(-2)^{m}}{3} b_{1}-\\frac{1-(-2)^{m+1}}{3} b_{1}= \\\\\n& \\quad=\\frac{2-2 \\cdot(-2)^{m}-1+(-2)^{m+1}}{3} b_{1}=\\frac{1-(-2)^{m+2}}{3} b_{1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis proves (3).\n\nFrom the definition of the sequence $b_{k}$, $b_{k} \\geq 1-n-2 k$. From this, using (3), we can obtain lower and upper estimates for $b_{1}$ by substituting some odd and even number for $k$. Let $m$ be a positive integer; substituting $k=2 m+1$ and $k=2 m$,\n\n$$\n-1-n-4 m \\leq b_{2 m+1}=\\frac{1+2^{2 m+1}}{3} b_{1}, 1-n-4 m \\leq b_{2 m}=\\frac{1+2^{2 m}}{3} b_{1}\n$$\n\nThe coefficient of $b_{1}$ in the first inequality is positive, in the second it is negative. If we divide by it, the direction of the first inequality changes, but not the second. This gives us the following estimate:\n\n$$\n-\\frac{3(n+4 m+1)}{1+2^{2 m+1}} \\leq b_{1} \\leq \\frac{3(n+4 m-1)}{2^{2 m}-1}\n$$\n\nIf we now let $m \\rightarrow \\infty$, then both the lower and upper estimates tend to 0, so $b_{1}=0$.\n\nBased on the work of G\u00e1bor Zsolt T\u00f3th (Budapest, \u00c1rp\u00e1d Gimn., III. o.t.) and Benedek Valk\u00f3 (Fazekas M. F\u00f3v. Gyak. Gimn., IV. o.t.)\n\nRemarks. 1. The second solution is actually a generalized version of the first. The case distinctions of the first solution were calculated simultaneously. For example, if $f(1)=x$, then based on the functional equation, we can determine that $f(x)=8-x, f(8-x)=3 x-2, f(3 x-2)=24-5 x, f(24-5 x)=11 x-22, f(11 x-22)=76-21 x$ and so on. For the last two numbers to be positive integers, it is necessary that $11 x-22 \\geq 1$ and $76-21 x \\geq 1$, that is, $2 \\frac{1}{11} \\leq x \\leq 3 \\frac{4}{7}$. The only integer in this interval is 3.\n\n2. The second solution also works if the function $f$ maps the set of positive real numbers to itself. In this case, $f(x)=x+2$ is also the only solution."}]}

The LCM of $25$ and $13$ is $325$, so the answer is $\\boxed{6}$.[\/hide]","role":"user","thinking":null},{"content":"6","role":"assistant","thinking":"1. **Intersection of Lines**:\n   We start by finding the intersection of the lines $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$.

We can use the method of elimination or substitution.

Find $100m+n$.\n\n[i]Proposed by James Lin[\/i]","role":"user","thinking":null},{"content":"503","role":"assistant","thinking":"1. **Given Information and Setup:**\n   - We have integers \\(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4\\) with distinct absolute values.\n   - Points in the coordinate plane are \\(A_1 = (a_1, a_1^2)\\), \\(A_2 = (a_2, a_2^2)\\), \\(A_3 = (a_3, a_3^2)\\), and \\(A_4 = (a_4, a_4^2)\\).\n   - Lines \\(A_1A_2\\) and \\(A_3A_4\\) intersect on the \\(y\\)-axis at an acute angle \\(\\theta\\).\n   - We need to find the maximum possible value for \\(\\tan \\theta\\) expressed as \\(\\frac{m}{n}\\) for relatively prime positive integers \\(m\\) and \\(n\\), and then find \\(100m + n\\).\n\n2. **Slope Calculation:**\n   - The slope of line \\(A_1A_2\\) is:\n     \\[\n     m_1 = \\frac{a_2^2 - a_1^2}{a_2 - a_1} = a_2 + a_1\n     \\]\n   - The slope of line \\(A_3A_4\\) is:\n     \\[\n     m_2 = \\frac{a_4^2 - a_3^2}{a_4 - a_3} = a_4 + a_3\n     \\]\n\n3. **Intersection on the \\(y\\)-axis:**\n   - Since the lines intersect on the \\(y\\)-axis, their \\(x\\)-coordinates at the intersection point are zero. Thus, the \\(y\\)-intercepts of the lines are:\n     \\[\n     c_1 = a_1^2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad c_2 = a_3^2\n     \\]\n\n4. **Angle Between Lines:**\n   - The tangent of the angle \\(\\theta\\) between the two lines is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\tan \\theta = \\left| \\frac{m_1 - m_2}{1 + m_1 m_2} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{(a_1 + a_2) - (a_3 + a_4)}{1 + (a_1 + a_2)(a_3 + a_4)} \\right|\n     \\]\n\n5. **Maximizing \\(\\tan \\theta\\):**\n   - Let \\(x = a_1 + a_2\\) and \\(y = a_3 + a_4\\). We need to maximize:\n     \\[\n     f(x, y) = \\left| \\frac{x - y}{1 + xy} \\right|\n     \\]\n\n6. **Case Analysis:**\n   - **Case 1: \\(x, y > 0\\)**\n     - Here, \\(x, y \\geq 1\\) since they are integers. In this case, \\(|f(x, y)| < 1\\), which cannot exceed our current maximum.\n   - **Case 2: \\(x > 0, y < 0\\)**\n     - The numerator is positive, and the denominator is negative, so \\(|f(x, y)|\\) cannot be our maximum.\n   - **Case 3: \\(x < 0, y > 0\\)**\n     - Let \\(x = -u\\) and \\(y = v\\). We want to maximize:\n       \\[\n       \\frac{u + v}{uv - 1}\n       \\]\n     - We need to check when:\n       \\[\n       \\frac{u + v}{uv - 1} > \\frac{3}{2} \\implies 3(uv - 1) < 2(u + v) \\implies 3uv - 3 < 2u + 2v \\implies 3uv - 2u - 2v < 3\n       \\]\n     - If \\(u, v > 1\\), then it's impossible because \\(3uv - 2u - 2v \\geq 3\\) is false. Thus, we can let \\(v = 1\\) and need \\(u < 5\\).\n\n7. **Checking Specific Values:**\n   - For \\(u = 4\\) and \\(v = 1\\):\n     - We have \\(a_1 = -6, a_2 = 2, a_3 = 4, a_4 = -3\\).\n     - This gives:\n       \\[\n       \\tan \\theta = \\left| \\frac{(-6 + 2) - (4 - 3)}{1 + (-6 + 2)(4 - 3)} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{-4 - 1}{1 - 4} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{-5}{-3} \\right| = \\frac{5}{3}\n       \\]\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{503}\\)."}]}

Any $m_{i}$ and $a-1$ are powers of two.\n\nProof. Let $\\gamma$ be an arbitrary odd divisor of the number $m_{i}$ (possibly $\\gamma=1$), and let $p$ be any prime divisor of the number $a^{\\gamma}-1$. Then $A$ is divisible by $p$ (see fact 8), which means that in the right product there is a factor $a^{k_{j}}+1$ that is divisible by $p$ (see fact 9). Note that\n\n$$\n\\left(\\left(a^{k_{j}}\\right)^{\\gamma}+1\\right)-\\left(\\left(a^{\\gamma}\\right)^{k_{j}}-1\\right)=2\n$$\n\nOn the other hand, $\\left(a^{k_{j}}\\right)^{\\gamma}+1$ is divisible by $p$ since $a^{k_{j}}+1$ is divisible by $p$, and $\\left(a^{\\gamma}\\right)^{k_{j}}-1$ is divisible by $p$ since $a^{\\gamma}-1$ is divisible by $p$. Therefore, 2 is divisible by $p$, hence $p=2$. Thus, 2 is the only prime divisor of the number $a^{\\gamma}-1$, meaning that $a^{\\gamma}-1$ is a power of two (see fact 10), i.e., there exists some $K$ such that $2^{K}=a^{\\gamma}-1=\\left(a^{\\gamma-1}+\\ldots+a+1\\right)(a-1)$. Since $\\gamma$ is odd, the expression in the first parenthesis is an odd divisor of the number $2^{K}$, i.e., 1. Therefore, $\\gamma=1$. Consequently, $a-1=2^{K}$. Moreover, we have proved that one is the only odd divisor of the number $m_{i}$, meaning that $m_{i}$ is a power of two. The lemma is proved.\n\nSince $a-1>2$, then $a-1$ is divisible by 4, so $a^{k}+1$ gives a remainder of 2 when divided by 4 for any $k$ (see fact 7).\n\nLet $a_{i}=\\frac{a^{2^{i}}+1}{2}$. Then $a_{i}$ is an odd number. We will need the following formula:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\na^{2^{d}}-1=(a-1)(a+1)\\left(a^{2}+1\\right)\\left(a^{4}+1\\right) & \\ldots\\left(a^{2^{d-1}}+1\\right)= \\\\\n& =2^{K} \\cdot 2^{d} \\cdot a_{0} \\ldots a_{d-1} .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nLemma 2. All $a_{i}$ are pairwise coprime.\n\nProof. Consider the numbers $a_{i}$ and $a_{j}$ and prove that they are coprime. We can assume that $i>j$. By (2), $a^{2^{i}}-1$ is divisible by $a_{j}$, and on the other hand, $a^{2^{i}}+1$ is divisible by $a_{i}$. Therefore, any common divisor of the numbers $a_{i}$ and $a_{j}$ is also a divisor of the number\n\n$$\n2=\\left(a^{2^{i}}+1\\right)-\\left(a^{2^{i}}-1\\right) .\n$$\n\nTo complete the proof, it remains to note that the numbers $a_{i}$ and $a_{j}$ are odd. The lemma is proved.\n\nMultiplying the representations (2) for $a^{2^{m_{i}}}-1$, we obtain that $A$ is represented as $A=2^{N}\\left(a_{0}\\right)^{N_{0}} \\ldots\\left(a_{q}\\right)^{N_{q}}$, where $N>N_{0}+\\ldots+N_{q}$. Since each of the numbers $a^{k_{j}}+1$ gives a remainder of 2 when divided by 4, then $l=N$ (see (1)). But each of $a^{k_{j}}+1$ is divisible by one of the numbers $a_{i}$ (indeed, if $k_{j}=2^{r} s$, where $s$ is odd, then $a^{k_{j}}+1$ is divisible by $a_{r}$).

Now perform an inversion about $G$ with radius $G A=G B=G C$. Then the images of $X, Y, Z$ (call them $\\left.X^{\\prime}, Y^{\\prime}, Z^{\\prime}\\right)$ lie on $(G B C),(G A C),(G A B)$, so they are the feet of the perpendiculars from $A_{1}, B_{1}, C_{1}$ to line $X Y Z$, where $A_{1}, B_{1}, C_{1}$ are the respective antipodes of $G$ on $(G B C),(G A C),(G A B)$. But now $A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}$ is an equilateral triangle with medial triangle $A B C$, so its centroid is $G$. Now the centroid of (degenerate) triangle $X^{\\prime} Y^{\\prime} Z^{\\prime}$ is the foot of the perpendicular of the centroid of $A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}$ onto the line, so it is $G$. Thus $X^{\\prime} G+Y^{\\prime} G+Z^{\\prime} G=0$, which yields the desired claim.\n\nProof 2: Let $W$ be the point on line $X Y Z$ such that $W G=2 G X$ (in directed lengths). Now note that $(Y, Z ; G, W)$ is a harmonic bundle, since projecting it through $A$ onto $B C$ gives $\\left(B, C ; M_{B C}, \\infty_{B C}\\right)$.

From the number $\\frac{p^{2}+2 q}{q+r}$ we get that $p=2$. Since $\\frac{p^{2}+2 q}{q+r}=\\frac{4+2 q}{q+r}<2$, then $4+2 q=q+r$ or $r=q+4$. Since\n\n$$\n\\frac{r^{2}+3 p}{p+q}=\\frac{(q+4)^{2}+6}{2+q}=q+6+\\frac{10}{2+q}\n$$\n\nis an integer, then $q=3$ and $r=7$. It is easy to check that this triple works.

Let point $A$ have coordinates $\\left(x_{1} ; 0\\right)$, and point $C$ have coordinates $\\left(x_{2} ; 0\\right)$. From the condition, it is clear that $x_{1} < 0$ and $x_{2} > 0$. Since $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ are the roots of the quadratic trinomial $f(x)$, by Vieta's theorem, we have $x_{1} \\cdot x_{2} = 12b$, from which we get $b = \\frac{x_{1} \\cdot x_{2}}{12} < 0$.\n\nLet $H$ be the point with coordinates $(3 ; 0)$ (Fig. 11). Clearly, in the isosceles triangle $A T C$, the segment $T H$ is the height, and therefore it is also the median. Thus, $3 - x_{1} = A H = H C = x_{2} - 3$, from which we get $x_{1} = 6 - x_{2}$.\n\nLet $M$ be the point with coordinates $(0, 3)$. Since $T H = T M = 3$ and $T A = T B$, the right triangles $A T H$ and $B T M$ are equal by the leg and hypotenuse. Therefore, $3 - x_{1} = H A = M B = 3 - b$, that is, $x_{1} = b = \\frac{x_{1} \\cdot x_{2}}{12}$ (by Vieta's theorem), from which we find $x_{2} = 12$. Finally, $x_{1} = 6 - x_{2} = 6 - 12 = -6$ and $b = x_{1} = -6$.\n\nAnother solution. As in the previous solution, let the abscissas of points $A$ and $C$ be $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$, respectively; we will also use the fact that point $B$ has coordinates $(0 ; b)$. Immediately, we understand that $O A = |x_{1}| = -x_{1}$, $O C = |x_{2}| = x_{2}$, and $O B = |b| = -b$.\n\nLet's find the second intersection of the circle with the y-axis, let this be point $D$ with coordinates $(0 ; d)$ (Fig. 12). The chords $A C$ and $B D$ of the circle intersect at the origin $O$; from the properties of the circle, we know that $O A \\cdot O C = O B \\cdot O D$. We get $-x_{1} \\cdot x_{2} = -b \\cdot d$, from which, replacing $x_{1} \\cdot x_{2}$ with $12b$ by Vieta's theorem, we get $d = 12$.\n\n![](https:\/\/cdn.mathpix.com\/cropped\/2024_05_06_b46fbd582cc3a82460aeg-40.jpg?height=521&width=571&top_left_y=83&top_left_x=437)\n\nFig. 12: to the solution of problem 10.7\n\nIt remains to note that triangle $BTD$ is isosceles, and the midpoint of its base, point $M$, has coordinates $(0 ; 3)$. Reflecting point $D(0 ; 12)$ relative to it, we get $B(0 ; -6)$."}]}

For example, numbers like 11, 22, 101, etc., will be erased.\n\n3. **Effect of Decreasing by 1**:\n   - After each step, every integer in the list is decreased by 1. This means that the list will eventually contain nonpositive integers, which will be erased.\n\n4. **Key Observation**:\n   - The critical observation is to determine the maximum number of steps it takes for any integer to be erased.\n   - Consider the number 10. It will be decreased to 9, 8, 7, ..., 1, 0, and then -1. This process takes exactly 11 steps.\n\n5. **Erasure of Numbers with Repeated Digits**:\n   - Numbers like 11, 22, 33, ..., 99, 101, 111, etc., will be erased as soon as they appear in the list.\n   - For example, 11 will be erased in the first step, 22 in the second step, and so on.\n\n6. **General Case**:\n   - For any number \\( n \\) in the list, if it does not have repeated digits, it will be decreased step by step until it becomes nonpositive.\n   - The maximum number of steps required for any number to become nonpositive is determined by the number 10, which takes 11 steps.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the number 10 takes exactly 11 steps to be erased, and all other numbers will be erased in fewer or equal steps, the entire list will be empty after 11 steps.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{11}\n\\]"}]}

Then $x y+y z+z x+\\frac{1}{x}+\\frac{2}{y}+\\frac{5}{z}$ is indeed equal to\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{6} \\sqrt[3]{36}+\\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt[3]{36}+\\frac{1}{3} \\sqrt[3]{36}+3 \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{6}}+4 \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{6}}+5 \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{6}}=\\sqrt[3]{36}+12 \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{6}}=\\sqrt[3]{36}+2 \\sqrt[3]{36}=3 \\sqrt[3]{36}\n$$\n\nRemark. After deciding to split the inequality into three inequalities using the arithmetic-geometric mean (one for $x y$, one for $y z$, and one for $x z$), there are different ways to find the coefficients for $\\frac{1}{x}, \\frac{1}{y}$, and $\\frac{1}{z}$. First, you can be guided by examples you have found in your search for the equality case. For example, the expression equals 10 for $(x, y, z)=\\left(\\frac{2}{3}, 1,2\\right)$, and with $(x, y, z)=\\left(\\frac{3}{5}, \\frac{9}{10}, \\frac{9}{5}\\right)$, you get $\\frac{324}{100}+\\frac{12}{18} \\cdot 10=3.24+6.6666 \\ldots=9.9066 \\ldots$\n\nA more structured approach is to introduce variables $a, b, c, d, e, f$ for the inequalities on $x y+a \\frac{1}{x}+b \\frac{1}{y}, y z+c \\frac{1}{y}+d \\frac{1}{z}$, and $z x+e \\frac{1}{z}+f \\frac{1}{x}$. Since these three terms must add up to the desired expressions, we get the conditions\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf+a & =1 \\\\\nb+c & =2 \\\\\nd+e & =5\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFurthermore, we want equality to hold for certain $x, y$, and $z$. So the system\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& x y=a \\frac{1}{x}=b \\frac{1}{y} \\\\\n& y z=c \\frac{1}{y}=d \\frac{1}{z} \\\\\n& z x=e \\frac{1}{z}=f \\frac{1}{x}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nmust have a solution for some $x, y$, and $z$. From the first equation, it follows that $\\frac{x}{y}=\\frac{a}{b}$. But using the last two equations, we can also write this as\n\n$$\n\\frac{x}{y}=\\frac{z x}{y z}=\\frac{f \/ x}{c \/ y}=\\frac{f y}{c x}\n$$\n\nThis means that $\\frac{f}{c}=\\frac{x^{2}}{y^{2}}=\\frac{a^{2}}{b^{2}}$, or $a^{2} \/ f=b^{2} \/ c$. Similarly, we have $c^{2} \/ b=d^{2} \/ e$ and $e^{2} \/ d=f^{2} \/ a$. Together with $f+a=1, b+c=2$, and $d+e=5$, we now have six equations in six variables. Although it is not easy to solve this system, it greatly simplifies the search because it is now easy to check if $a, b, c, d, e, f$ satisfy the conditions. Other equations that can be derived from this system include $a c e=b d f$ and $a d=b e=c f$."}]}

What is the maximum number of birds on the circumference that has the most birds? (6th China Mathematical Olympiad)","role":"user","thinking":null},{"content":"9","role":"assistant","thinking":"Analysis and Solution: Use points to represent birds. Let the circle with the most points have $r$ points. Clearly, $r \\geqslant 4$. Can $r=4$? Let's first explore the case where $r=4$.\n\nIf $r=4$, i.e., each circle has at most 4 points, but we are considering circles that pass through at least 4 points, so each \"4-point circle\" has exactly 4 points.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the number of \"4-point circles\". Note the condition: any 5-point set has 4 points on a circle, i.e., each \"5-point set\" corresponds to a \"4-point circle\". Thus, we can use a mapping to count the number of circles. In fact, each \"5-point set\" corresponds to one \"4-point circle\", so there are $C_{10}^{5}=252$ \"4-point circles\". However, each \"4-point circle\" can belong to 6 different \"5-point sets\", and is counted 6 times, so the number of \"4-point circles\" is $\\frac{252}{6}=42$. These \"4-point circles\" are distinct. If not, there would be two different 4-point sets $A B C D$ and $A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime} D^{\\prime}$ on the same circle, but $A B C D$ and $A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime} D^{\\prime}$ would have at least 5 distinct points, and these 5 points would be on the same circle, contradicting $r=4$.\n\nStep 2: Observe the partition and use a middle quantity to count twice. The 42 different 4-point circles can be seen as 42 different (possibly intersecting) subsets, denoted as: $M_{1}, M_{2}, \\cdots, M_{42}$, which satisfy: $\\left|M_{i}\\right|=4$, $\\left|M_{i} \\cap M_{j}\\right| \\leqslant 2$. Using the \"addition technique\", we can calculate the number of triangles $S$.\n\nOn one hand, $S=C_{10}^{3}=120$. On the other hand, $S \\geqslant 42 \\mathrm{C}_{4}^{3}=168$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, $r>4$.\nLet $M$ be the circle with the most points, and by $r>4$, $M$ has at least 5 points $A, B, C, D, E$. We will prove: the other points (except possibly one point) are on this circle. (*)\n\nIn fact, suppose there are two points $P, Q$ not on circle $M$, then among the 5 points $P, Q, A, B, C$, 4 points are on a circle. But $P, Q$ are not on circle $A B C$, so $P, Q$ must be on a circle with two of $A, B, C$, say $P, Q, A, B$ are on circle $M_{1}$.\n\nSimilarly, consider the 5 points $P, Q, C, D, E$, there must be 4 points among $P, Q$ and $C, D, E$ on a circle, say $P, Q, C, D$ are on circle $M_{2}$. Now consider the 5 points $P, Q, A, C, E$, there must be 4 points among $P, Q$ and $A, C, E$ on a circle.\n(i) If $P, Q, A, C$ are on circle $M_{3}$, then $M_{3}$ coincides with $M_{1}$, so $P Q A B C$ are on the same circle, and $P, Q$ are on circle $M$, a contradiction.\n(ii) If $P, Q, A, E$ are on circle $M_{3}$, then $M_{3}$ coincides with $M_{1}$, so $P Q A B E$ are on the same circle, and $P, Q$ are on circle $M$, a contradiction.\n(iii) If $P, Q, C, E$ are on circle $M_{3}$, then $M_{3}$ coincides with $M_{2}$, so $P Q C D E$ are on the same circle, and $P, Q$ are on circle $M$, a contradiction.\n\nIn summary, conclusion $(*)$ holds, i.e., $r \\geqslant 9$. Finally, $r=9$ is possible, i.e., 9 points are on the same circle, and the other point is outside the circle, which clearly meets the condition.\n\nIn conclusion, the minimum value of $r$ is 9."}]}

We also know that:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{r=0}^n \\binom{n}{r} p^r (1-p)^{n-r} = 1\n   \\]\n6. Hence:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{r=0}^n \\left(2a_r - \\binom{n}{r}\\right) p^r (1-p)^{n-r} = 0\n   \\]\n7. Suppose \\( p = \\frac{a}{b} \\) where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are coprime positive integers with \\( a < b \\). Then, the above becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{r=0}^n \\left(2a_r - \\binom{n}{r}\\right) \\left(\\frac{a^r (b-a)^{n-r}}{b^n}\\right) = 0\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{r=0}^n \\left(2a_r - \\binom{n}{r}\\right) a^r (b-a)^{n-r} = 0\n   \\]\n8. Since \\( \\gcd(a, b-a) = 1 \\), \\( a \\) must divide \\( 2a_0 - 1 \\). But \\( 0 \\le a_0 \\le 1 \\). So \\( a \\) must be \\( 1 \\).\n9. Similarly, \\( (b-a) \\) must divide \\( 2a_n - 1 \\). Again \\( 0 \\le a_n \\le 1 \\). Hence \\( (b-a) \\) is also equal to \\( 1 \\), which gives \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( b = 2 \\). So \\( p \\) must be \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n10.

Consider an arbitrary red dragon. To the right of this dragon, at least one head must tell the truth.

Now consider the dragon to the left of the chosen red dragon. By similar reasoning, we understand that only the 1st head can tell the truth, and to the left of this dragon, there must be a green one.\n\nFrom the previous reasoning, we get that for any red dragon, one position to the right there is definitely a blue dragon, and one position to the left - a green one. For each red dragon, we combine these three dragons into one group. Note that any dragon can be in at most one such group. Then we get that there are no more than $530 \/ 3$ < 177, i.e., no more than 176 such groups. Therefore, there are no more than 176 red dragons.\n\nNow let's provide an example.

An interesting fact is that all three daughters were born on March 18. Today, March 18, 2014, is their birthday. Noting another curious fact, Francisco says:\n\n- Alina, your age is now double the age of Valentina.\n\na) Show that this could never have happened before and that, after the next birthday of Valentina, it will never happen again.\n\nThen, Alina, who was very clever, exclaimed:\n\n- Dad, exactly 10 years ago, the age of one of us three was double the age of another, and in 10 years, the same fact will happen again!\n\nb) It is known that the oldest of the daughters is over 30 years old. How old is Civela?","role":"user","thinking":null},{"content":"15","role":"assistant","thinking":"Solution\n\na) It is clear that Alina is older than Valentina. Let's call the difference in age between Alina and Valentina $d$. Since they were born on the same day of the year, $d$ does not vary (note that this would not be true if they were born on different days, as in that case, the difference would change on the birthday of each one).\n\nIf Valentina's age today is $\\alpha$, then Alina's age must be $2 \\alpha$, so the age difference between the two is given by:\n\n$$\nd=2 \\alpha-\\alpha\n$$\n\nWe conclude that $d=\\alpha$, so Alina is $2 d$ years old and Valentina is $d$ years old.\n\nSuch a relationship between the ages of Alina and Valentina could not have happened before, as Valentina was younger than $d$ years old. It also will not happen again, as Valentina will be older than $d$ years.\n\nb) Let's call the age of the youngest daughter $A$, the age of the middle daughter $B$, and the age of the oldest daughter $C$. Let $x=B-A$ be the age difference between the two youngest, and $y=C-B$ be the age difference between the two oldest daughters. The age difference between the youngest and the oldest is therefore $C-A=x+y$. Since they were born on the same day of the year, these differences do not vary.\n\nIt is known that in each of the years 2004, 2014, and 2024, the age of one of the daughters was, is, or will be double the age of one of the others. For this, there are only 3 possibilities:\n\n(i) $B$ is double $A$.\n\n(ii) $C$ is double $B$.\n\n(iii) $C$ is double $A$.\n\nBy the reasoning used in part a), we know that each situation can only occur in one of the three years. Therefore, the three situations: (i), (ii), and (iii) must happen in the three years: 2004, 2014, and 2024, but we do not yet know in what order. Also, from part a), we know that:\n\n- When (i) happens, $B$ must be equal to $2 x$ and $A$ must be equal to $x$. Moreover, $C$ is equal to $B+y$, that is, $C$ must be equal to $2 x+y$.\n- When (ii) happens, $B=y, C=2 y$, and therefore, $A=y-x$.\n- When (iii) happens, $C=2(x+y), A=x+y$, and therefore, $B=2 x+y$.\n\nObserve that the ages of $A$ in cases (i), (ii), and (iii) are\n\n$$\nx, \\quad y-x \\quad \\text { and } \\quad x+y\n$$\n\nrespectively. Since $x<x+y$ and $y-x<x+y$, we conclude that $x+y$ is the largest of the three ages and, therefore, (iii) must happen in the year 2024. Only remains to see in which of the two years 2004 or 2014 each of the events in (i) and (ii) happens. Let's assume that (i) and (ii) happen in the years 2014 and 2004, respectively. Then, the ages of $A$ in the years 2004, 2014, and 2024 would be $y-x, x$, and $x+y$, respectively. Thus, we would have the equations\n\n$$\ny-x+10=x \\quad \\text { and } \\quad x+10=x+y\n$$\n\nSolving, we would have $x=10$ and $y=10$. But in that case, $C$ would be today equal to $2 x+y=30$. But the oldest daughter is more than 30 years old, as stated in the problem. We discard, then, this possibility.\n\nWe know then that (i) and (ii) happen in the years 2004 and 2014, respectively. Then, the ages of $A$ in the years 2004, 2014, and 2024 are $x, y-x$, and $x+y$, respectively. Therefore, we have that\n\n$$\nx+10=y-x \\quad \\text { and } \\quad y-x+10=x+y .\n$$\n\nSolving, we get $x=5$ and $y=20$. Finally, the ages of Francisco's daughters today are equal to\n\n$$\ny-x=15, \\quad y=20 \\quad \\text { and } \\quad 2 y=40\n$$\n\nSince Alina's age must be double Valentina's age, the ages of Alina and Valentina must be 40 and 20, respectively. Therefore, Civela is 15 years old today."}]}

Similarly, by the pigeonhole principle, a contradiction is derived. The lemma is proved.\nFor the original problem, we discuss two scenarios:\n(1) The maximum degree of all points is 4.\nBy the lemma, there are two points with a degree of 4, and the rest of the points have a degree of 3. Assume these two points are $A$ and $B$. At this time, the degree of the points other than $A$ and $B$ is 3.\n(i) If points $A$ and $B$ are not connected, this can be further divided into two scenarios: the four points connected to $A$ and $B$ are not repeated; the four points connected to $A$ and $B$ have one repetition (if the points connected to $A$ and $B$ have two repetitions, it will form a quadrilateral). Additionally, there is at most one point $D$.\n\nBut each point in the above groups needs to draw two more edges (not to the points in the same group, but to the other group, at most one edge). Therefore, the edges drawn to point $D$ are more than 4, which is a contradiction.\n(ii) If points $A$ and $B$ are connected, assume point $A$ is connected to $A_{1}$, $A_{2}$, $A_{3}$, and point $B$ is connected to $B_{1}$, $B_{2}$, $B_{3}$, as shown in Figure 6. The other two points are $C$ and $D$.\n\nSimilarly, $A_{i}$ and $B_{i}$ ($i=1,2,3$) each draw one edge to point $C$ or $D$. Therefore, one of the points $C$ or $D$ draws three edges, forming a quadrilateral, which is a contradiction.\n(2) The maximum degree of a point is not less than 5, assume the maximum degree is $i$ ($i \\geqslant 5$).\n\nAssume the point with a degree of $i$ is $A$, and the $i$ points connected to it are $A_{1}$, $A_{2}$, ..., $A_{i}$; the other $9-i$ points are $B_{1}$, $B_{2}$, ..., $B_{9-i}$. Then, point $B_{j}$ ($j=1,2, \\cdots, 9-i$) can only be connected to $A_{1}$, $A_{2}$, ..., $A_{i}$. Among them, $B_{j}$ cannot be connected to two points at the same time (otherwise, it will form a quadrilateral).\n\nTherefore, $B_{1}$, $B_{2}$, ..., $B_{9-i}$ can connect at most $9-i$ line segments to $A_{1}$, $A_{2}$, ..., $A_{i}$.\n\nNow consider how many line segments can be connected between $B_{1}$, $B_{2}$, ..., $B_{9-i}$.\n\nAccording to the assumption, we need to connect $16-(9-i)-i=7$ more line segments.\nThe maximum number of line segments that can be connected between $9-i$ points is\n$$\nC_{9-i}^{2}=\\frac{(9-i)(8-i)}{2} \\text {. }\n$$\n\nBy $i \\geqslant 5$, we know $C_{9-i}^{2} \\leqslant 6<7$, which is a contradiction, so this scenario is excluded.\nIn summary, the maximum number of line segments that can be connected is not 16. Therefore, the original proposition holds, and the maximum value is 15.\n(Du Yulin, Experimental Class 4, Tianjin Yaohua Middle School, 300040)\n\nSolution 2 Let the ten points be $A_{1}$, $A_{2}$, ..., $A_{10}$, and the edges between them form a graph $G(V, E)$.

We can group numbers based on their digits.

First, when 6 points in a plane are the 5 vertices of a regular pentagon and its center, all triangles formed by these 6 points are isosceles triangles, so the required positive integer \\( n \\geqslant 7 \\). Next, if there exist 7 points in a plane (where no three points are collinear) such that all triangles formed by these 7 points are isosceles triangles. Let the set of these 7 points be \\( E \\). Without loss of generality, assume the two farthest points in \\( E \\) are \\( A \\) and \\( B \\). Draw arcs centered at \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) with radius \\( AB \\) intersecting at points \\( M \\) and \\( N \\). Let \\( l_{1} = \\overparen{M A N} \\cup \\overparen{M B N} \\), and \\( l_{2} = \\) line segment \\( M N \\). Take any \\( P \\in E, P \\neq A \\), \\( P \\neq B \\), then \\( \\triangle P A B \\) is an isosceles triangle. Thus, at least one of the following three cases holds: (1) \\( P A = P B \\leqslant A B \\); (2) \\( P A = A B \\geqslant P B \\); (3) \\( P B = A B \\geqslant P A \\), so \\( P \\in l_{1} \\cup l_{2} \\). Since no three points in \\( E \\) are collinear, there are at most 2 points of \\( E \\) on \\( l_{2} \\), so at least \\( 7 - 2 - 2 = 3 \\) points of \\( E \\) are on \\( \\overparen{A M} \\), \\( \\overparen{B M} \\), \\( \\overparen{A N} \\), \\( \\overparen{B N} \\) (excluding endpoints). Without loss of generality, assume there is a point \\( C \\in E \\) on \\( \\overparen{B N} \\) (where \\( C \\neq B \\), \\( C \\neq N \\)), and \\( \\overparen{B C} \\) contains no points of \\( E \\).

Let \\( l_{3} = \\overparen{M' A N'} \\cup \\overparen{M' C N'} \\), and \\( l_{4} = \\) line segment \\( M' N' \\). Similarly, all points of \\( E \\) belong to \\( l_{3} \\cup l_{4} \\).

So, \\( S_{1} \\) or \\( S_{2} \\) contains at least 2 points of \\( E \\) different from \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\). Without loss of generality, assume \\( S_{2} \\) contains 2 points \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) of \\( E \\) different from \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\), then there are only two cases: (1) \\( P \\in \\overparen{C N} \\), \\( Q \\in \\overparen{C N} \\). Since \\( \\triangle P B C \\) is an isosceles triangle and \\( P B > B C \\), we have \\( P C = B C \\). Similarly, from \\( \\triangle Q B C \\) being an isosceles triangle, we get \\( Q C = B C \\). So, \\( C P = C Q \\), i.e., \\( C \\) lies on the perpendicular bisector of \\( P Q \\), but the perpendicular bisector of \\( P Q \\) only passes through \\( A \\) and not through \\( C \\), a contradiction. (2) \\( P \\in \\overparen{C N} \\), \\( Q = R \\). Similarly, we get \\( P C = B C \\).

To stop a knight from attacking four others, one must remove either this knight or one of those it attacks.

We will show that the sought maximum $n$ is equal to 21.\n\nFirst, we verify that no natural number $n \\geq 22$ has the required property. For each such $n$, the set $\\{1,2, \\ldots, n\\}$ contains even numbers $4,6,8, \\ldots, 22$, which are not prime numbers (we excluded the smallest even number 2) and the required number of which is $(22-4): 2+1=10$. Since the sum of any two of these 10 listed numbers will not be a prime number (it will be an even number greater than 2), the statement of the problem does not hold for these 10 numbers. Therefore, no $n \\geq 22$ satisfies the condition.\n\nNow we prove that $n=21$ has the required property. If we select any 10 different numbers from the set $\\{1,2, \\ldots, 21\\}$, none of which are prime numbers (otherwise there is nothing to prove), we actually select 10 different numbers from the set $M = \\{1,4,6,8,9,10,12,14,15,16,18,20,21\\}$. We divide it for further purposes into a group of odd numbers and a group of even numbers:\n\n$$\nL=\\{1,9,15,21\\} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad S=\\{4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20\\}\n$$\n\nWe see that $L$ has 4 elements and $S$ has 9 elements. Therefore, among the 10 selected numbers, there is at least one number from $L (10-9=1)$ and at least 6 numbers from $S (10-4=6)$, meaning that at most 3 numbers from $S$ are not selected $(9-6=3)$. In other words, at least one of any four numbers from $S$ is selected.\n\nWe now distinguish which of the odd numbers 1, 9, 15, 21 is selected (this will be a discussion of four cases, which do not necessarily exclude each other).\n\n$\\triangleright$ The number 1 is selected. Since $1+4, 1+6, 1+10, 1+16$ are prime numbers and at least one of the four even numbers 4, 6, 10, 16 must be selected (according to the conclusion of the previous paragraph), the statement of the problem holds for the selected 10 numbers.\n\n$\\triangleright$ The number 9 is selected. Similarly, we use the four sums $9+4, 9+8, 9+10, 9+14$.\n\n$\\triangleright$ The number 15 is selected. This time, we use the four sums $15+4, 15+8, 15+14, 15+16$.\n\n$\\triangleright$ The number 21 is selected. In this case, the appropriate four sums are $21+8, 21+10, 21+16, 21+20$.\n\nNote. There are many other ways to show that when selecting any 10 different numbers from the set\n\n$$\nM=\\{1,4,6,8,9,10,12,14,15,16,18,20,21\\}\n$$\n\nthe sum of some two selected numbers will be a prime number. Usually, more cases need to be considered than in our solution, but one sophisticated method requires no substantial case analysis, and we will now describe it.\n\nWe divide the entire set $M$ into 9 mutually disjoint subsets\n\n$$\n\\{1,4\\},\\{6\\},\\{8,9\\},\\{10\\},\\{12\\},\\{14,15\\},\\{16\\},\\{18\\},\\{20,21\\}\n$$\n\nSince there are 9 subsets, when selecting any 10 different numbers from the set $M$, at least one of the two-element subsets must have both of its elements selected. For each of these, the sum of its elements is a prime number.\n\n## GUIDING AND ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS:\n\nN1. Show that from the set $\\{1,2,3, \\ldots, 10\\}$, 4 different numbers can be selected such that none of them is a prime number and no two of them have a sum that is a prime number. Also find all such selections. [The valid selection $4,6,8,10$ is the only one. It must consist of 4 numbers from the set $\\{1,4,6,8,9,10\\}$, which has 6 elements. The number 1 cannot be in the selection with the three numbers 4, 6, and 10, so it is \"unusable.\" The same applies to the number 9 due to a similar \"conflict\" with the three numbers 4, 8, and 10. Thus, only the four even numbers $4,6,8,$ and 10 are possible. Their selection works because the sum of any two of them is also an even number different from 2.]\n\nN2. Show that for any natural number $n \\geq 2$, from the set $\\{1,2,3, \\ldots, 2n\\}$, $n-1$ numbers can be selected such that none of them is a prime number and no two of them have a sum that is a prime number. [The selection will have the required property if it is composed, for example, of even composite numbers. This is satisfied by the selection of $n-1$ numbers $4,6,8, \\ldots, 2n$.]\n\nD1. Show that the number of all six-digit prime numbers does not exceed 300,000. [Six-digit numbers range from 100000 to 999999, totaling 900000. It is sufficient to show that at least 600000 of them are divisible by 2 or 3. There are 450000 divisible by 2 and 300000 divisible by 3. In the sum $450000+300000=750000$, numbers divisible by both 2 and 3, i.e., divisible by 6, are counted twice. There are 150000 such numbers, so the number of six-digit numbers divisible by 2 or 3 is exactly $750000-150000=600000$.

On the board, all proper divisors of some composite natural number $n$, increased by 1, were written down. Find all such numbers $n$ for which the numbers on the board turn out to be all proper divisors of some natural number $m$. (Proper divisors of a natural number $a>1$ are all its natural divisors, different from $a$ and from 1.) (A. Khryabrov)","role":"user","thinking":null},{"content":"n=4orn=8","role":"assistant","thinking":"Answer: $n=4$ or $n=8$.\n\nFirst solution. Note that the number 2 is not written on the board, because 1 is not a proper divisor of $n$; hence, $m$ is odd. Therefore, all the divisors of $m$ are odd, and thus all the divisors of $n$ are even. Thus, $n$ does not divide by odd prime numbers, meaning $n$ is a power of two (and all its divisors are also powers of two).\n\nIf $n$ is divisible by 16, then 4 and 8 are its proper divisors, so 5 and 9 are written on the board. Therefore, $m$ is divisible by 45, and in particular, 15 is its proper divisor. But the number 15 could not have been written, since 14 is not a power of two. Therefore, $n$ cannot be divisible by 16.\n\nThe remaining composite powers of two, $n=4$ and $n=8$, fit: for them, we can respectively set $m=9$ and $m=15$.\n\nSecond solution. Let $a_{1}n \/ a_{2}>\\ldots>$ $>n \/ a_{k}$ be the proper divisors of the number $n$. Then they correspond to $a_{k}, a_{k-1}, \\ldots, a_{1}$, meaning $a_{i} a_{k+1-i}=n$ for all $i=1,2, \\ldots, k$. A similar reasoning can be applied to the divisors of the number $m$.\n\nSuppose $k \\geqslant 3$. Then $a_{1} a_{k}=a_{2} a_{k-1}=n$ and $\\left(a_{1}+1\\right)\\left(a_{k}+1\\right)=$ $=\\left(a_{2}+1\\right)\\left(a_{k-1}+1\\right)=m$, from which $a_{1}+a_{k}=a_{2}+a_{k-1}=m-$ $-n-1$. We see that the pairs of numbers $\\left(a_{1}, a_{k}\\right)$ and ( $a_{2}, a_{k-1}$ ) have the same sum and product; by Vieta's theorem, they are pairs of roots of the same quadratic equation, meaning these pairs must coincide - a contradiction.\n\nThus, $k \\leqslant 2$; this is possible if $n=p^{2}, n=p^{3}$, or $n=p q$, where $p$ and $q$ are prime numbers (in the last case, we assume $p<q$). Note that $p$ is the smallest proper divisor of $n$, and from the condition, $p+1$ is the smallest proper divisor of $m$, meaning $p+1$ is a prime number. Therefore, $p=2$. The cases $n=2^{2}$ and $n=2^{3}$ fit, as noted in the first solution. The case $n=2 q$ is impossible. Indeed, in this case, $m$ has only two proper divisors, 3 and $q+1$, so $m=3(q+1)$, and $q+1$ is a prime number different from 3, or nine; both cases are impossible for a prime $q$."}]}

[25] Into how many regions can a circle be cut by 10 parabolas?","role":"user","thinking":null},{"content":"201","role":"assistant","thinking":"Answer: 201 We will consider the general case of $n$ parabolas, for which the answer is $2 n^{2}+1$. We will start with some rough intuition, then fill in the details afterwards. The intuition is that, if we make the parabolas steep enough, we can basically treat them as two parallel lines. Furthermore, the number of regions is given in terms of the number of intersections of the parabolas that occur within the circle, since every time two parabolas cross a new region is created. Since two pairs of parallel lines intersect in 4 points, and pairs of parabolas also intersect in 4 points, as long as we can always make all 4 points of intersection lie inside the circle, the parallel lines case is the best we can do.\nIn other words, the answer is the same as the answer if we were trying to add ten pairs of parallel lines. We can compute the answer for pairs of parallel lines as follows - when we add the $k$ th set of parallel lines, there are already $2 k-2$ lines that the two new lines can intersect, meaning that each of the lines adds $2 k-1$ new regions ${ }^{1}$. This means that we add $4 k-2$ regions when adding the $k$ th set of lines, making the answer $1+2+6+10+14+\\cdots+(4 n-2)=1+2(1+3+5+7+\\cdots+(2 n-1))=1+2 \\cdot n^{2}=2 n^{2}+1$. Now that we have sketched out the solution, we will fill in the details more rigorously. First, if there are $n$ parabolas inside the circle, and the they intersect in $K$ points total, then we claim that the number of regions the circle is divided into will be at most $K+n+r+1$, where $r$ is the number of parabolas that intersect the circle itself in exactly four points.\nWe will prove this by induction. In the base case of $n=0$, we are just saying that the circle itself consists of exactly one region.\nTo prove the inductive step, suppose that we have $n$ parabolas with $K$ points of intersection. We want to show that if we add an additional parabola, and this parabola intersects the other parabolas in $p$ points, then this new parabola adds either $p+1$ or $p+2$ regions to the circle, and that we get $p+2$ regions if and only if the parabola intersects the circle in exactly four points.\nWe will do this by considering how many regions the parabola cuts through, following its path from when it initially enters the circle to when it exits the circle for the last time. When it initially enters the circle, it cuts through one region, thereby increasing the number of regions by one ${ }^{2}$. Then, for each other parabola that this parabola crosses, we cut through one additional region. It is also possible for the parabola to leave and then re-enter the circle, which happens if and only if the parabola intersects\n${ }^{1}$ This is the maximum possible number of new regions, but it's not too hard to see that this is always attainable.\n${ }^{2}$ While the fact that a curve going through a region splits it into two new regions is intuitively obvious, it is actually very difficult to prove. The proof relies on some deep results from algebraic topology and is known as the Jordan Curve Theorem. If you are interested in learning more about this, see http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jordan_curve_theorem\nthe circle in four points, and also adds one additional region. Therefore, the number of regions is either $p+1$ or $p+2$, and it is $p+2$ if and only if the parabola intersects the circle in four points. This completes the induction and proves the claim.\nSo, we are left with trying to maximize $K+n+r+1$. Since a pair of parabolas intersects in at most 4 points, and there are $\\binom{n}{2}$ pairs of parabolas, we have $K \\leq 4\\binom{n}{2}=2 n^{2}-2 n$. Also, $r \\leq n$, so $K+n+r+1 \\leq 2 n^{2}+1$. On the other hand, as explained in the paragraphs giving the intuition, we can attain $2 n^{2}+1$ by making the parabolas sufficiently steep that they act like pairs of parallel lines. Therefore, the answer is $2 n^{2}+1$, as claimed."}]}

For i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, let p i (n) = prob that the final score is n+i if the player stops when his total score is at least n. We note that p(n) is also the probability that the player's total equals n on some throw if he throws repeatedly. Now we can see that p 5 (n) = 1\/6 p(n-1), because the only way to achieve a final score of n+5 without passing through n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4 is to reach n-1 and then throw a 6. Similarly, p 4 (n) = 1\/6 p(n-1) + 1\/6 p(n-2), because to reach n+4 without passing through n, n+1, n+2, n+3 you must either to through n-1, which requires reaching n-1 and then throwing a 5, or not, in which case you must reach n-2 and then throw a 6. Similarly, p 3 (n) = 1\/6 p(n-1) + 1\/6 p(n-2) + 1\/6 p(n-3), p 2 = 1\/6 p(n-1) + 1\/6 p(n-2) + 1\/6 p(n-3) + 1\/6 p(n-4), and p 1 (n) = 1\/6 p(n-1) + 1\/6 p(n-2) + 1\/6 p(n-3) + 1\/6 p(n-4) + 1\/6 p(n-5). Adding, we get: 1 = p(n) + p 1 (n) + p 2 (n) + p 3 (n) + p 4 (n) + p 5 (n) = p(n) + 5\/6 p(n-1) + 4\/6 p(n-2) + 3\/6 p(n-3) + 2\/6 p(n-4) + 1\/6 p(n-5). In the limit, p(n-5) = p(n-4) = ... = p(n). Hence we get: p 1 (n) = 5\/6 p(n), p 2 (n) = 4\/6 p(n), p 3 (n) = 3\/6 p(n), p 4 (n) = 2\/6 p(n), p 5 (n) = 1\/6 p(n). But they sum to 1, so p(n) = 2\/7. The objection to the above is that it fails to establish that lim p(n) exists. So one should arguably add the following. We have (as above) p(n) = 1\/6 p(n-1) + 1\/6 p(n-2) + 1\/6 p(n-3) + 1\/6 p(n-4) + 1\/6 p(n-5) + 1\/6 p(n-6) (*). Let m(n) = min{ p(n-1), p(n-2), p(n-3), p(n-4), p(n-5), p(n-6) }. Then (*) establishes that p(n) \u2265 m(n), and so m(n+1) \u2265 m(n). Similarly, let M(n) = max{ p(n-1), p(n-2), p(n-3), p(n-4), p(n-5), p(n-6) }. Then (*) shows that p(n) \u2264 M(n), so M(n+1) \u2264 M(n). Thus m(n) is a monotonic increasing sequence and M(n) is a monotonic decreasing sequence. But m(n) is obviously bounded above by any M(m), and M(n) is bounded below by any m(m). So both sequences converge. Suppose they converged to different limits. So m(n) converges to m and M(n) converges to M with M - m > 36k > 0. Take n sufficiently large that m(n) > m - 6k. At least one of the terms on the rhs of (*) must equal M(n) and the others are at least m(n), so p(n) \u2265 5\/6 m(n) + 1\/6 M(n) > 5\/6 (m - 6k) + 1\/6 M > 5\/6 m - 5k + 1\/6 (m + 36k) = m+ k. But that means that m(n) > m+k for all sufficiently large n. Contradiction. Hence M and m are the same and p(n) must have the same limit. 21st Putnam 1960 \u00a9 John Scholes jscholes@kalva.demon.co.uk 15 Feb 2002"}]}

Before we think that the triangle does not exist, let's consider that the triangle can be constructed without any further issues. The problem lies elsewhere.\n\nWhen we rounded $a$ to two decimal places, 8.48 is smaller than the actual value, thus reducing the denominator in the sine rule and increasing the value of the fraction and thus $\\sin \\gamma$. The consequence of rounding is usually the inaccuracy of the final result, but in this case, $\\gamma$ is in a critical range: approximately $90^{\\circ}$, with a sine value close to 1. The rounding, therefore, changes not the value of the result but its nature. It also becomes clear that $\\sin \\gamma$ is approximately 1, indicating that the triangle is nearly a half-cut equilateral triangle, with an angle of about $90^{\\circ}$ at vertex $C$.\n\nLet's calculate more precisely.

Similarly for those in sixth and fifth columns we get $\\left(D_{1,6}-10\\right)\\left(D_{1,3}-D_{1,2}\\right)$ and $\\left(D_{1,5}-10\\right)\\left(D_{1,2}-D_{1,1}\\right)$. Finally the median moves to the fourth column again, staying there remaining $D_{1,1}$ times, contributing $\\left(D_{1,4}-10\\right) D_{1,1}$. Overall, the sum of all medians is thus\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}\nD_{1,4}\\left(10-D_{1,7}\\right)+D_{1,3}\\left(D_{1,7}-D_{1,6}\\right)+D_{1,2}\\left(D_{1,6}-D_{1,5}\\right)+ \\\\\nD_{1,1}\\left(D_{1,5}-D_{1,4}\\right)+\\left(D_{1,7}-10\\right)\\left(D_{1,4}-D_{1,3}\\right)+\\left(D_{1,6}-10\\right)\\left(D_{1,3}-D_{1,2}\\right) \\\\\n+\\left(D_{1,5}-10\\right)\\left(D_{1,2}-D_{1,1}\\right)+\\left(D_{1,4}-10\\right) D_{1,1} .\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nIt is fairly easy to see that this expression is in fact equal to 0 (for example, by considering the linear and quadratic terms separately). This means that the sum of new medians $M_{i}$ is zero, and the sum of the original $m_{i}$ 's is 45 , as wanted,\n\nSolution 2: We will prove a stronger claim: for all $a$, the number of $m_{i}$ 's equal to $a$ equals the number of $m_{i}$ 's equal to $9-a$. (By a pairing argument, this implies that the average of the $m_{i}^{\\prime}$ 's is $9 \/ 2$.) Indeed, for $1 \\leq j \\leq 10$ let $M_{i, j}$ denote the $j$ th smallest entry in row $i$ of the table (so that $m_{i}=M_{i, 4}$ ); we will show that for all $a$ and $j$, the number of $M_{i, j}$ 's equal to $a$ equals the number of $M_{i, 8-j}$ 's equal to $9-a$.\nHenceforth, all row-indices are to be interpreted modulo 10 , and \"between\" is meant in the inclusive sense.\nIt follows from the defining property of the table that for all $i$ between 1 and 10 , all $a$ between 0 and 9 , and all $k$ between 0 and $a$, the number of $k$ 's in row $i$ equals the number of $k+a$ 's in row $i+a$. Replacing $a$ by $9-a$, and summing over all $k$ between 0 and $a$, we find that the number of entries between 0 and $a$ in row $i$ equals the\nnumber of entries between $9-a$ and 9 in row $i+9-a$. Hence for all $j$, the number of entries between 0 and $a$ in row $i$ is greater than or equal to $j$ if and only if the number of entries between $9-a$ and 9 in row $i+9-a$ is greater than or equal to $j$. But this means that the $j$ smallest entries in row $i$ are all between 0 and $a$ if and only if the $j$ largest entries in row $i+9-a$ are all between $9-a$ and 9 . That is, $M_{i, j} \\leq a$ if and only if $M_{i+9-a, 8-j} \\geq 9-a$. Replacing $a$ by $a-1$, we see also that $M_{i, j} \\leq a-1$ if and only if $M_{i+10-a, 8-j} \\geq 10-a$. Combining the last two facts, we conclude that $M_{i, j}=a$ if and only if $M_{i+10-a, 8-j}=9-a$. Summing over $i$ (and noting that $i+10-a$ varies over $0,1, \\ldots, 9 \\bmod 10$ as $i$ does), we see that the number of $i$ 's with $M_{i, j}=a$ equals the number of $i$ 's with $M_{i, 8-j}=9-a$, as was claimed above."}]}

From the 9 \"horizontal\" lines, we can choose 2 in $\\binom{9}{2}$ ways, and from the $n$ \"vertical\" lines, we can choose 2 in $\\binom{n}{2}$ ways.\n\nThus, the number of rectangles is\n\n$$\n\\binom{9}{2} \\cdot\\binom{n}{2}=18 n(n-1)\n$$\n\nb) In the drawn grid, each rectangle is uniquely determined by its diagonals. Since the number of grid points is $9 n$, we can choose one end of the diagonal in this many ways. The other end cannot be in the same row or column as the chosen point, so we can choose it in $(9-1)(n-1)=8(n-1)$ ways.\n\nThus, on the one hand, we counted each diagonal twice, and on the other hand, we counted each rectangle according to both of its diagonals, so the number of resulting rectangles is\n\n$$\n\\frac{9 n \\cdot 8(n-1)}{4}=18 n(n-1)\n$$\n\nSolving the equation $18 n(n-1)=756$ for $n$, we get two roots: -6 and 7. The former is clearly not a solution, so the value of $n$ is 7."}]}

Here is a proof using this language, in our situation.\n\nLet \\( M \\subset \\mathbb{R}^3 \\) be the surface \\( s = 0 \\). We first contend \\( M \\) is a two-dimensional manifold. Indeed, the gradient \\( \\nabla s = \\langle 2 y z - 1, 2 z x - 1, 2 x y - 1 \\rangle \\) vanishes only at the points \\( \\left( \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right) \\) where the \\( \\pm \\) signs are all taken to be the same. These points do not lie on \\( M \\), so the result follows by the regular value theorem. In particular, the topological closure of points on \\( M \\) with \\( x y z \\neq 0 \\) is all of \\( M \\) itself; so \\( Q \\) vanishes on all of \\( M \\).\n\nIf we now identify \\( M \\) with the semi-algebraic set consisting of maximal ideals \\( (x - a, y - b, z - c) \\) in \\( \\operatorname{Spec} \\mathbb{R}[x, y, z] \\) satisfying \\( 2 a b c = a + b + c \\), then we have real dimension two, and thus the Zariski closure of \\( M \\) is a two-dimensional closed subset of \\( \\operatorname{Spec} \\mathbb{R}[x, y, z] \\). Thus it must be \\( Z = \\mathcal{V}(2 x y z - (x + y + z)) \\), since this \\( Z \\) is an irreducible two-dimensional closed subset (say, by Krull's principal ideal theorem) containing \\( M \\). Now \\( Q \\) is a global section vanishing on all of \\( Z \\), therefore \\( Q \\) is contained in the (radical, principal) ideal \\( (2 x y z - (x + y + z)) \\) as needed. So it is actually divisible by \\( 2 x y z - (x + y + z) \\) as desired.\n\nNow we regard \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) as complex polynomials instead. First, note that substituting \\( (x, y, z) = (t, -t, 0) \\) implies \\( P \\) is even. We then substitute\n$$\n(x, y, z) = \\left(x, \\frac{i}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\frac{-i}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\n$$\nto get\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& x P(x) + \\frac{i}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( P\\left( \\frac{i}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right) - P\\left( \\frac{-i}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right) \\right) \\\\\n= & \\frac{1}{2} x \\left( P\\left( x - \\frac{i}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right) + P\\left( x + \\frac{i}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right) + P(\\sqrt{2} i) \\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nwhich in particular implies that\n$$\nP\\left( x + \\frac{i}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right) + P\\left( x - \\frac{i}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right) - 2 P(x) \\equiv P(\\sqrt{2} i)\n$$\nidentically in \\( x \\). The left-hand side is a second-order finite difference in \\( x \\) (up to scaling the argument), and the right-hand side is constant, so this implies \\( \\operatorname{deg} P \\leq 2 \\).\n\nSince \\( P \\) is even and \\( \\operatorname{deg} P \\leq 2 \\), we must have \\( P(x) = c x^2 + d \\) for some real numbers \\( c \\) and \\( d \\).

If $n+1$ is a prime, then $i j \/(n+1)$ is never integral and $S=\\frac{1}{4} n^{2}(n-1)$\n\nSolution 2. To simplify the calculation with indices, extend the table by adding a phantom column of index 0 with zero entries (which will not change the sum of the table). Fix a row $i$ with $1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n$, and let $d:=\\operatorname{gcd}(i, n+1)$ and $k:=(n+1) \/ d$. For columns $j=0, \\ldots, n$, define the remainder $r_{j}:=i j \\bmod (n+1)$. We first prove the following\nClaim. For every integer $g$ with $1 \\leqslant g \\leqslant d$, the remainders $r_{j}$ with indices $j$ in the range\n$$\n(g-1) k \\leqslant j \\leqslant g k-1\n$$\nform a permutation of the $k$ numbers $0 \\cdot d, 1 \\cdot d, 2 \\cdot d, \\ldots,(k-1) \\cdot d$.\nProof. If $r_{f^{\\prime}}=r_{j}$ holds for two indices $j^{\\prime}$ and $j$ in (2), then $i\\left(j^{\\prime}-j\\right)=0 \\bmod (n+1)$, so that $j^{\\prime}-j$ is a multiple of $k$; since $\\left|j^{\\prime}-j\\right| \\leqslant k-1$, this implies $j^{\\prime}=j$. Hence, the $k$ remainders are pairwise distinct. Moreover, each remainder $r_{j}=i j \\bmod (n+1)$ is a multiple of $d=\\operatorname{god}(i, n+1)$. This proves the claim.\nWe then have\n$$\n\\sum_{j=0}^{n} r_{j}=\\sum_{g=1}^{d} \\sum_{\\ell=0}^{(n+1) \/ d-1} \\ell d=d^{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{n+1}{d}-1\\right) \\frac{n+1}{d}=\\frac{(n+1-d)(n+1)}{2} .\n$$\n\nBy using (3), compute the sum $S_{i}$ of row $i$ as follows:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nS_{i}=\\sum_{j=0}^{n}\\left\\lfloor\\frac{i j}{n+1}\\right\\rfloor= & \\sum_{j=0}^{n} \\frac{i j-r_{j}}{n+1}=\\frac{i}{n+1} \\sum_{j=0}^{n} j-\\frac{1}{n+1} \\sum_{j=0}^{n} r_{j} \\\\\n& =\\frac{i}{n+1} \\cdot \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}-\\frac{1}{n+1} \\cdot \\frac{(n+1-d)(n+1)}{2}=\\frac{(i n-n-1+d)}{2} .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nEquation (4) yields the following lower bound on the row sum $S_{1}$, which holds with equality if and only if $d=\\operatorname{gcd}(i, n+1)=1$ :\n$$\nS_{i} \\geqslant \\frac{(i n-n-1+1)}{2}=\\frac{n(i-1)}{2} .\n$$\n\nBy summing up the bounds (5) for the rows $i=1, \\ldots, n$, we get the following lower bound for the sum of all entries in the table\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} S_{i} \\geqslant \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{n}{2}(i-1)=\\frac{n^{2}(n-1)}{4} .\n$$\n\nIn (6) we have equality if and only if equality holds in (5) for each $i=1, \\ldots, n$, which happens if and only if $\\operatorname{god}(i, n+1)=1$ for each $i=1, \\ldots, n$, which is equivalent to the fact that $n+1$ is a prime. Thus the sum of the table entries is $\\frac{1}{4} n^{2}(n-1)$ if and only if $n+1$ is a prime.\n\nComment. To simplify the answer, in the problem statement one can make a change of variables by introducing $m:=n+1$ and writing everything in terms of $m$. The drawback is that the expression for the sum will then be $\\frac{1}{4}(m-1)^{2}(m-2)$ which seems more artificial."}]}

Clarifying this would not have been possible within the time of the competition (see the following 3rd remark).\n\nRemarks. 1. Some may still know the following formulas, which allow for \"easier\" (i.e., using logarithm tables) calculation of angles from the sides, compared to the \"cumbersome\" cosine rule:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{tg} \\frac{\\gamma}{2}=\\sqrt{\\frac{(s-a)(s-b)}{s(s-c)}}, \\quad \\sin \\frac{\\gamma}{2}=\\sqrt{\\frac{(s-a)(s-b)}{a b}}, \\quad \\cos \\frac{\\gamma}{2}=\\sqrt{\\frac{s(s-c)}{a b}}\n$$\n\n(The similar formulas for the other two angles can be written by cyclic permutation of the sides, while $s$ remains unchanged.) According to the first formula,\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{tg} \\frac{\\gamma}{2}=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\varrho \\cdot \\varrho_{c}}{\\varrho_{a} \\cdot \\varrho_{c}}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\varrho^{2} q^{3}}{\\varrho^{2} q^{3}}}=1\n$$\n\n$\\frac{\\gamma}{2}=45^{\\circ}, \\gamma=90^{\\circ}$. Here, the existence of the triangle is guaranteed because the formulas only give meaningless results for non-existent triangles.\n\n2. The mentioned formulas - and many similar ones - are from the era when the most advanced tool for computation was the logarithm table. In the following - only in large steps - came the mechanical calculators with gears, first manual, then motorized, and today the electronic calculators. (We omitted the slide rule, which was only good for quick estimates compared to these.) - The formulas are still valid today. - However, the $\\operatorname{tg} x \/ 2$ appears, for example, in the transformation of certain integrals; but it is impossible to list all such small but well-usable tricks in theory.\n3. For a right triangle that also satisfies the $\\varrho_{b}: \\varrho_{a}=q$ requirement, we get a cubic equation for the tangent of half the larger acute angle. Similarly to the above,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\operatorname{tg} \\frac{\\beta}{2}=\\sqrt{\\frac{(s-a)(s-c)}{s(s-b)}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\varrho \\cdot \\varrho_{b}}{\\varrho_{a} \\cdot \\varrho_{c}}}=\\frac{1}{q} \\quad \\text { and } \\\\\n& \\operatorname{tg} \\frac{\\alpha}{2}=\\frac{1}{q^{2}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n(i.e., the tangents of the half-angles also form a geometric sequence with 3 elements and the same ratio). From these,\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{tg}^{2} \\frac{\\beta}{2}=\\frac{1}{q^{2}}=\\operatorname{tg} \\frac{\\alpha}{2}=\\operatorname{tg}\\left(45^{\\circ}-\\frac{\\beta}{2}\\right)= \\\\\n=\\frac{1-\\operatorname{tg} \\frac{\\beta}{2}}{1+\\operatorname{tg} \\frac{\\beta}{2}}=\\frac{1-\\frac{1}{q}}{1+\\frac{1}{q}}=\\frac{q-1}{q+1} \\\\\nq^{3}-q^{2}-q-1=0\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\n(This \"beautiful\" equation also pops up in the solution of many other simply formulated problems.) Its approximate solution is:\n\n$$\nq=1.83929, \\quad \\alpha=32^{\\circ} 56^{\\prime} 6^{\\prime \\prime}, \\quad \\beta=57^{\\circ} 3^{\\prime} 54^{\\prime \\prime}\n$$\n\nSecond solution. In addition to the notation used in the previous solution, let the vertices of the triangle be $A, B, C$, the center of the inscribed circle be $O$, and the centers of the excircles be $O_{a}, O_{b}, O_{c}$ such that the circle centered at $O_{a}$ touches the extensions of the sides $A B$ and $A C$, and the side $B C$ from the outside, and so on. Thus, the line $O O_{a}$ bisects the angle $B A C$, and the line $O_{b} O_{c}$ bisects the exterior angles at $A$, making it perpendicular to $O A$. $O$ is the orthocenter of the triangle $O_{a} O_{b} O_{c}$ and an interior point of the triangle, so this triangle is acute-angled.\n\n![](https:\/\/cdn.mathpix.com\/cropped\/2024_05_02_823261d193f0d3d28e5bg-2.jpg?height=1093&width=943&top_left_y=993&top_left_x=580)\n\nLet the points of tangency of the circles on the line $A B$ be $E, E_{a}, E_{b}, E_{c}$, respectively. From the similar right triangles $A O E$ and $A O_{a} E_{a}$, as well as $A O_{b} E_{b}$ and $A O_{c} E_{c}$,\n\n$$\n\\frac{A O_{a}}{A O}=\\frac{E_{a} O_{a}}{E O}=\\frac{\\varrho_{a}}{\\varrho}=q=\\frac{\\varrho_{c}}{\\varrho_{b}}=\\frac{E_{c} O_{c}}{E_{b} O_{b}}=\\frac{A O_{c}}{A O_{b}}\n$$\n\n(The elements to the right of $q$ are in the same logical order as the others from left to $q$.) Let's make a small swap in the ratios at the two ends of the sequence:\n\n$$\n\\frac{A O_{a}}{A O_{c}}=\\frac{A O}{A O_{b}}\n$$\n\nAccording to this, the ratios of the legs of the right triangles $A O_{a} O_{c}$ and $A O O_{b}$ are equal. Therefore, these two triangles are similar. For one of their corresponding angles and the vertex angle of the latter,\n\n$$\nA O_{a} O_{c} \\varangle\\left(=O O_{a} B \\varangle\\right)=A O O_{b} \\varangle=O_{a} O B \\varangle,\n$$\n\nwhich means that the angles of the right triangle $O O_{a} B$ are equal, so each is $45^{\\circ}$.\n\nOn the other hand, the Thales circle over the segment $O O_{a}$ passes through $B$ and $C$, and these are on the opposite side of $O O_{a}$, so\n\n$$\n\\frac{A C B \\varangle}{2}=O C B \\varangle=O O_{a} B \\varangle=45^{\\circ}\n$$\n\nthus $A C B \\varangle=90^{\\circ}$, which is then the largest angle of the triangle $A B C$.

Since $2^{18}$, $3^{12}$, $5^{10}$, and $7^{6}$ are all at least six-digit numbers, we only need to check the following 13 cases (the corresponding $p^{q-1}+q^{p-1}$ values are listed in the table).\n\n| $p q q$ | 2 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 11 | 13 | 17 |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| 2 | 4 | 7 | 21 | 71 | 1035 | 4109 | **65553** |\n| 3 |  | 18 | 106 | 778 | **59170** |  |  |\n| 5 |  |  | 1250 | **18026** |  |  |  |\n\nIn these cases, the possible values of $N$ and $M$ (considering that they can be swapped) are:\n\n| $p$ | $q$ | $N$ | $M$ |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| 2 | 17 | 65536 | 17 |\n| 17 | 2 | 17 | 65536 |\n| 3 | 11 | 59049 | 121 |\n| 11 | 3 | 121 | 59049 |\n| 5 | 7 | 15625 | 2401 |\n| 7 | 5 | 2401 | 15625 |\n\nNote. Unfortunately, during the grading, relatively few solutions received full marks. Many provided the primes but not the numbers $N$ and $M$, which was a result of inattention. Many also provided only three solutions instead of six, and did not realize that $N$ and $M$ can be swapped. Many did not provide sufficiently detailed reasoning, resulting in lost points (usually either they did not derive the expressions for $N$ and $M$ in terms of $p$ and $q$, or they only listed the correct primes, showed that they were indeed correct, but did not explain why other solutions were not possible). Those who provided only the final result without any reasoning received 0 points, as the competition rules state that points cannot be awarded for just the result. However, there were also some excellent solutions."}]}

Consider the edges incident with a vertex $A$. At least three of them have the same color. say blue. Suppose that four of them, $A B, A C, A D, A E$, are blue. There is a blue edge, say $B C$, among the ones joining $B, C, D, E$. Then four of the edges joining $A, B, C, D$ are blue, and we cannot complete the coloring. So, exactly three edges from $A$ are blue: $A B, A C, A D$. Also, of the edges connecting any three of the 6 vertices other than $A, B, C, D$, one is blue (because the edges joining them with $A$ are not so). By a classical result, there is a blue triangle $E F G$ with vertices among these six. Now one of $E B, E C, E D$ must be blue as well, because none of $B C, B D, C D$ is. Let it be $E B$.

Find the interval of convergence of the series.\n\nBy the Cauchy criterion, the interval of convergence is determined by the inequality\n\n$$\n|f(x)|<1\n$$\n\nIf $f(x)= \\pm 1$, the series diverges (the necessary condition for convergence is not satisfied). Therefore, the interval of convergence is determined by the inequalities $-1<f(x)<1$.\n\n2. In the original series, make the substitution $f(x)=t$ and write it as the sum of two series\n\n$$\n\\sum_{n=k}^{\\infty} n t^{n}+b \\sum_{n=k}^{\\infty} t^{n}\n$$\n\nThus, it is sufficient to find the sums of the series\n\n$$\n\\sum_{n=k}^{\\infty} t^{n} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\sum_{n=k}^{\\infty} n t^{n}\n$$\n\n3. The formula for the sum of the terms of an infinitely decreasing geometric progression is known\n\n$$\n\\sum_{n=k}^{\\infty} t^{n}=\\frac{t^{k}}{1-t}, \\quad|t|<1\n$$\n\n4. Moreover, we have the obvious equality\n\n$$\n\\sum_{n=k}^{\\infty} n t^{n}=t \\sum_{n=k}^{\\infty} n t^{n-1}=t \\sum_{n=k}^{\\infty} \\frac{d}{d t} t^{n}\n$$\n\n5. Considering that a power series can be differentiated term by term at any point in the interval of convergence, and using formula (1), we get\n\n$$\n\\sum_{n=k}^{\\infty} n t^{n}=t \\frac{d}{d t} \\sum_{n=k}^{\\infty} t^{n}=t \\frac{d}{d t} \\frac{t^{k}}{1-t}, \\quad t \\in(-1,1)\n$$\n\n6. Compute the derivative and substitute $t$ with $f(x)$. Write the answer: the sum of the series and the interval of its convergence.\n\nNote. If the series has the form\n\n$$\n\\sum_{n=k}^{\\infty}\\left(n^{2}+b n+c\\right) f(x)^{n}\n$$\n\nthen we compute the sum of three series, and when computing the sum of the series\n\n$$\n\\sum_{n=k}^{\\infty} n^{2} f(x)^{n}\n$$\n\nwe apply the theorem on term-by-term differentiation of a power series twice."}]}

Note that in a regular 20-sided polygon, the vertices taken every other one form a regular 10-sided polygon, and the vertices of this 10-sided polygon, taken every other one, form a regular 5-sided polygon. Therefore, it is sufficient to compare two quantities: $4 a_{20}^{2}$ and $a_{5}^{2}$, where $a_{20}$ and $a_{5}$ are the side lengths of the regular 20-sided and 5-sided polygons, respectively. Consider the corresponding fragment and introduce the vertex notations as shown in Fig. 11.3a, b. We can reason in different ways from here.\n\nFirst method. We use the fact that for $n>4$, the angle of any regular $n$-sided polygon is obtuse. Consider the triangle $A_{1} A_{2} A_{3}$ with the obtuse angle $A_{2}$ (see Fig. 11.3a). By the corollary of the cosine theorem, $2 a_{20}^{2}\\frac{8}{3}\\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\\right)>4 a_{20}^{2}$, from which the answer follows.\n\nThird method. We use the formula for calculating the side lengths of regular $n$-sided polygons inscribed in a circle of radius $R: a_{n}=2 R \\sin \\frac{180^{\\circ}}{n}$.

Take 35 equally spaced points around the circle and place 5 birds at each of 15 points and 4 birds at the other 20 points.

Suppose bird P is at A and bird Q is at B, where A and B are distinct but \u2220AOB \u2264 10 o . Suppose that h birds are visible from A not B, and that k birds are visible from B not A. Without loss of generality h \u2264 k. Now suppose all the birds at B move to A. Then the number of mutually visible pairs will not increase. By repeating this operation, we get to a configuration where two birds can see each other only if they are at the same point. Since the number of pairs has not been increased, it is sufficient to consider configurations where two birds can only see ach other if they are at the same point. Thus we may take 35 positions, labeled 1, 2, 3, ... , 35 and place x i birds at position i (we allow x i to be 0). So we wish to minimise \u00bd \u2211 x i (x i - 1), or equivalently \u2211 x i 2 , subject to \u2211 x i = 155. Suppose two of the x i differ by more than 1, without loss of generality x 1 > x 2 + 1.

Solution. a) The sum of all numbers from 1 to 20 is 210. It is obvious that the second group contains more than one number, since otherwise it would be equal to the sum of the remaining 19 numbers, i.e., no less than \\(1+2+\\ldots+19=190\\). We will show that in fact the second group contains more than two numbers. Indeed, otherwise for the numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) from the second group, we would have the equality \\(210-a-b=ab\\), which can be rewritten as \\(211=(a+1)(b+1)\\). However, the last equation has no solutions in integers from 1 to 20, since the number 211 is prime. Now let's give an example of the second group consisting of three numbers. We will look for such an example in the simplest form, assuming that one of the sought numbers is 1. Then the remaining two numbers will be found from the equality \\(209-a-b=ab\\), which can be rewritten as \\(210=(a+1)(b+1)\\). The last equation gives two examples that fit the condition of the problem: \\((1,9,20)\\) and \\((1,13,14)\\). b) The number of numbers in the second group is less than six: indeed, otherwise their product would be no less than \\(1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 6=720>210\\). Let's try to find an example of five numbers in the form of the set \\((1,2,3,4,x)\\) with an unknown \\(x\\) (from 5 to 20).

(b) 6.\n\nSolution. (a) Since the graph of $G(x)$ is symmetric with respect to the line $x=-8$, the points at which it takes the same value must be divided into pairs of symmetric points, except possibly one point that lies on the axis of symmetry. Therefore, the middle of the five given points should lie on the axis of symmetry, i.e., $x_{3}=-8$. The first and fifth points should be symmetric with respect to the line $x=-8$, so $x_{1}+x_{5}=2 \\cdot(-8)=-16$. Therefore, $x_{1}+x_{3}+x_{5}=-24$.\n\n(b) Consider the auxiliary polynomial $F(x)=G(x-8)-2022$. Clearly, the degree of $F(x)$ coincides with the degree of $G(x)$. The graph of $F(x)$ is obtained by a parallel shift of the graph of $G(x)$ 8 units to the right and 2022 units down. Then this graph is symmetric with respect to the line $x=0$, and at five points $F(x)$ takes the value 0. It is clear that $F(x)$ has exactly 5 distinct roots, so its degree is at least 5. On the other hand, since the graph of $F(x)$ is symmetric with respect to the line $x=0$, the function $F(x)$ is even, so the degree of $F(x)$ is also even. Therefore, the degree of $F(x)$, and hence the degree of $G(x)$, is at least 6.\n\nAs an example of a polynomial of degree 6, we can take $F(x)=(x+2)(x+1)x^{2}(x-1)(x-2)$.

We will use combinatorial methods and probability calculations to achieve this.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have a rectangular chocolate bar divided into two halves: dark chocolate on the left and white chocolate on the right.\n   - We randomly select 4 points on the top segment \\(P_0P_5\\) and label them \\(P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\\) from left to right.\n   - Similarly, we randomly select 4 points on the bottom segment \\(Q_0Q_5\\) and label them \\(Q_1, Q_2, Q_3, Q_4\\) from left to right.\n   - The segments \\(P_1Q_1, P_2Q_2, P_3Q_3, P_4Q_4\\) divide the chocolate bar into 5 smaller trapezoidal pieces.\n   - We need to find the probability that exactly 3 of these pieces contain both dark and white chocolate.\n\n2. **Case Analysis:**\n   - We need to consider the possible ways the points can be distributed such that exactly 3 pieces contain both dark and white chocolate.\n   - This can happen in two main cases:\n     - **Case 1:** The points on both the top and bottom segments are split in a \\(1:3\\) ratio around the midline.\n     - **Case 2:** One segment has a \\(2:2\\) ratio and the other segment has a \\(4:0\\) ratio.\n\n3. **Case 1: \\(1:3\\) Ratio on Both Sides:**\n   - The probability of selecting 1 point on the dark side and 3 points on the white side for the top segment is \\(\\frac{\\binom{4}{1}}{16}\\).\n   - Similarly, the probability for the bottom segment is also \\(\\frac{\\binom{4}{1}}{16}\\).\n   - Since this can happen in two ways (either the first point is on the dark side or the last point is on the dark side), we multiply by 2.\n   - Therefore, the probability for this case is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{\\binom{4}{1}}{16} \\times \\frac{\\binom{4}{1}}{16} \\times 2 = \\frac{4}{16} \\times \\frac{4}{16} \\times 2 = \\frac{1}{8}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Case 2: \\(2:2\\) Ratio and \\(4:0\\) Ratio:**\n   - The probability of selecting 2 points on the dark side and 2 points on the white side for one segment is \\(\\frac{\\binom{4}{2}}{16}\\).\n   - The probability of selecting all 4 points on one side (either all dark or all white) for the other segment is \\(\\frac{\\binom{4}{0}}{16}\\).\n   - Since this can happen in two ways (either the top segment has the \\(2:2\\) ratio or the bottom segment has the \\(2:2\\) ratio), we multiply by 2.\n   - Additionally, for each of these, there are 2 ways to choose which side has the \\(4:0\\) ratio (all dark or all white), so we multiply by another 2.\n   - Therefore, the probability for this case is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{\\binom{4}{2}}{16} \\times \\frac{\\binom{4}{0}}{16} \\times 2 \\times 2 = \\frac{6}{16} \\times \\frac{1}{16} \\times 4 = \\frac{3}{32}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Total Probability:**\n   - Adding the probabilities from both cases, we get:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{3}{32} = \\frac{4}{32} + \\frac{3}{32} = \\frac{7}{32}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Final Answer:**\n   - The probability that exactly 3 pieces of chocolate contain both dark and white chocolate is \\(\\frac{7}{32}\\).\n   - Therefore, \\(m = 7\\) and \\(n = 32\\), and \\(m + n = 7 + 32 = 39\\).\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{39}\\)."}]}

Hence, the exponent must be 3.\n\n3. **Check \\( k = 1 \\)**:\n   - For \\( k = 1 \\), \\( 3^1 + 5^1 = 3 + 5 = 8 \\), which is indeed \\( 2^3 \\). Thus, \\( k = 1 \\) works.\n\n4. **Assume \\( k > 1 \\)**:\n   - Since \\( k \\) is odd, we need to check higher values of \\( k \\).\n\n5. **Consider \\( k \\) modulo 9**:\n   - For \\( k \\) to be a cube, \\( 3^k + 5^k \\) modulo 9 must be \\( -1, 0, \\) or \\( 1 \\). Since \\( k \\) is odd, \\( 3^k \\equiv 3 \\pmod{9} \\) and \\( 5^k \\equiv 5 \\pmod{9} \\). Therefore, \\( 3^k + 5^k \\equiv 3 + 5 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{9} \\). This is not congruent to \\( -1, 0, \\) or \\( 1 \\), so \\( k \\) cannot be a multiple of 3 modulo 6.\n\n6. **Consider \\( k \\) modulo 7**:\n   - For \\( k \\) to be a cube, \\( 3^k + 5^k \\) modulo 7 must be \\( -1, 0, \\) or \\( 1 \\). Since \\( k \\) is odd, \\( 3^k \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7} \\) and \\( 5^k \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7} \\). Therefore, \\( 3^k + 5^k \\equiv 6 + 6 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7} \\). This is not congruent to \\( -1, 0, \\) or \\( 1 \\), so \\( k \\) cannot be a multiple of 3 modulo 6.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since no \\( k > 1 \\) works, the only solution is \\( k = 1 \\).\n\nThe final answer is \\( \\boxed{ k = 1 } \\)."}]}
