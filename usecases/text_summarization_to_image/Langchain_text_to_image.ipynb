photovoltaic (PV) system can reliably produce electricity for your home or office. These small or distributed solar systems are often installed by home or business owners to offset their electricity costs. If you want to purchase a rooftop solar system for your home,  federal tax credits , and other\\xa0 state, local, or utility incentives  can offset some of the upfront cost. There are also several  financing options  available for homeowners, including  energy-saving mortgages , home equity,  Property Assessed Clean Energy Loans , and more traditional bank loans. Solar PV systems installed in 2020 and 2021 are eligible for a 26% tax credit. In August 2022, Congress passed an extension of the ITC, raising it to 30% for the installation of which was between 2022-2032.\\xa0(Systems installed on or before December 31, 2019 were also eligible for a 30% tax credit.)\\xa0It will decrease to 26% for systems installed in 2033 and to 22% for systems installed in 2034. The tax credit expires starting in 2035 unless Congress renews it.\\xa0 There is no maximum amount that can be claimed. Learn more \\xa0and\\xa0 find state and local incentives .\\xa0 Leases and power purchase agreements (PPAs) are options for those who are unable to purchase a system, though these options are not eligible for tax breaks or other incentives. If you think solar is not an option for you because you rent or do not have adequate sunshine at your location your home, have inadequate solar resources, or lack financing, you may still benefit from  community solar , where the benefits of a solar project, likely from an off-site solar array, flow to multiple customers.\\xa0 And there numerous other ways that make solar easier, cheaper, and more accessible.

These small or distributed solar systems are often installed by home or business owners to offset their electricity costs. If you want to purchase a rooftop solar system for your home,  federal tax credits , and other\\xa0 state, local, or utility incentives  can offset some of the upfront cost. There are also several  financing options  available for homeowners, including  energy-saving mortgages , home equity,  Property Assessed Clean Energy Loans , and more traditional bank loans. Solar PV systems installed in 2020 and 2021 are eligible for a 26% tax credit. In August 2022, Congress passed an extension of the ITC, raising it to 30% for the installation of which was between 2022-2032.\\xa0(Systems installed on or before December 31, 2019 were also eligible for a 30% tax credit.)\\xa0It will decrease to 26% for systems installed in 2033 and to 22% for systems installed in 2034. The tax credit expires starting in 2035 unless Congress renews it.\\xa0 There is no maximum amount that can be claimed. Learn more \\xa0and\\xa0 find state and local incentives .\\xa0 Leases and power purchase agreements (PPAs) are options for those who are unable to purchase a system, though these options are not eligible for tax breaks or other incentives. If you think solar is not an option for you because you rent or do not have adequate sunshine at your location your home, have inadequate solar resources, or lack financing, you may still benefit from  community solar , where the benefits of a solar project, likely from an off-site solar array, flow to multiple customers.\\xa0 And there numerous other ways that make solar easier, cheaper, and more accessible.
