    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gained a lot of popularity due to their advanced natural language processing and understanding abilities. In 2018, the state of the art NLP task accuracy was set by BERT-large with its 340M parameters and novel transformers architecture. After just a few years, state-of-the-art model size has grown by more than 500x with models such as OpenAI’s 175 billion parameter GPT-3 and the similarly sized open source Falcon 180B by TII, raising the bar on NLP accuracy. The surge in parameter count is caused by the straightforward and empirically proven correlation between model size and performance that bigger often means better. As model repositories like HuggingFace, that provide convenient access to models and NLP tasks such as classification and text/code generation, continue to improve, users are increasingly opting for these large models. Nonetheless, the deployment of these models can present challenges due to their substantial size. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our era of data driven enterprises, a lot of data is stored in structured databases. SQL (Structured Query Language) has long been the language of data manipulation, enabling professionals to extract valuable insights from vast databases. However, for many, learning SQL has a steep learning curve and thus remains intimidating. \n",
    "With the rise of LLMs, we can now leverage their code generation capabilities to interact with these database using natural language, having SQL only as an intermediate step. \n",
    "This allows us to democratise data to non-technical people, build chat-bots on enterprise data, and also assist SQL experts like data scientists with their tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this Lab we will explore how to build a Generative AI powered application to query structured data from Amazon Relational Database Service using natural language on AWS.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create an RDS Database instance backed by the Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL engine and populate it with synthetic data. Furthermore, we will deploy the [Code Llama](https://ai.meta.com/blog/code-llama-large-language-model-coding/) (7B) model by [Meta](https://ai.meta.com/) using Amazon SageMaker Jumpstart. \n",
    "Our database schema of synthetic data looks as follows:\n",

    "### Background and details\n",
    "\n",
    "We have two primary types of knowledge for LLMs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Parametric knowledge: refers to everything the LLM learned during training and acts as a frozen snapshot of the world for the LLM.\n",
    "* Source knowledge: covers any information fed into the LLM via the input prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "When infusing knowledge into Generative AI powered applications, we need to decide which of these types to target. In previous labs, we have elevated the parametric knowledge through fine tuning. Fine-tuning can be a resource intensive task and many practitioners opt for targeting the source knowledge. Luckily, Meta's Code Llama, comes as a fine-tuned version of Llama-2, for code-secific tasks. This Lab is about using prompt engineering techniques to leverage the code capabilities of our model to query our specific data.  \n",
    "The application we will be building in a step-by-step process will be a LLM powered dashboard for you to query synthetic data of a made up software company. You will be able to query the database through a frontend and receive information, specific to the underlying data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow of our demo application looks as following. We feed the (1) user's question in natural language to our model hosted on an SageMaker Endpoint using some prompt engineering techniques, which we dive deeper into in this Notebook. (2) The LLM converts the question in natural language to a SQL query, which is (3) directly excecuted on our database. Our application is designed in a way to (4) return the results of the query to the user directly, alongside with (5) an answer to the question in Natural Language.\n",
    "\n",
    "![workflow](./img/workflow.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture\n",
    "The mentioned architecture is implemented using the three main services: \n",
    "* AWS Elastic Beanstalk\n",
    "* Amazon SageMaker\n",

    "#### Zero-Shot prompting\n",

    "We ask the model to create an SQL statement given our instruction in natural language as you can see below. This should generate us a correct SQL statement and your output should look similar to this: \n",
    "```SQL \n",
    "SELECT * FROM employees;\n",
    "``` \n",
    "Next to our prompt, we also need to feed in hyperparameters. The hyperparameters are: \n",
    "* `max_new_tokens`, define the maximum number of tokens to generate in this call.\n",
    "* `temperature`, which let's you control how deterministic a model's responses are. Setting temperature to 1.0 samples directly from the model distribution. Lower (higher) values increase the chance of sampling higher (lower) probability tokens. A value of 0 essentially disables sampling and results in greedy decoding, where the most likely token is chosen at every step. To find out more about temperature you can have a look [here](https://www.promptingguide.ai/introduction/settings.en). We choose relatively low temperature, as we want deterministic SQL results.\n",
    "* `top_p` is also a sampling technique, with which you can control how deterministic the models generation is. A lower value keeps the answers factual, while higher values make the responses more diverse. Intuitively, instead of sampling only from the most likely _k_ words, this method samples from the smallest possible set of words, whose summed up probability exeeds `p`. This is also known as nucleus sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, you must explicitly accept the EULA to deploy the model via SageMaker SDK. Note that by default, `accept_eula` is set to `false`. You need to set `accept_eula=true` to invoke the endpoint successfully. By doing so, you accept the user license agreement and acceptable use policy.

    "#### Few-Shot prompting\n",
    "Now we define some examples for our model, which we will use in our prompt as well. Here we show, in which style and format we want the answer through examples. We try to cover as many different query types as possible to let the model generalize as well as possible. We limit ourselves to 6 samples, because we don't want to bias our model towards the sample queries when running inference. The number of examples that should be chosen is heaviliy dependent on the size and complexity of the data and should be chosen on a case to case basis. For more complex databases it might make sense to store multiple few-shot examples using a vector database and use only a few of them dynamically for each query. More information and an example on this approach can be found [here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/qa_structured/sql#including-dynamic-few-shot-examples) and for more information on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/jumpstart-foundation-models-customize-rag.html)\n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we saw a simple workflow on how to build a Natural Language to SQL demo leveraging the code generation capabilities of LLMs using Amazon SageMaker Jumpstart. Later we deployed the entire containerized application through AWS Elastic Beanstalk and built a frontend around it using the open source library Streamlit. \n",
    "We have the following learnings:\n",
    "* We deployed the Code Llama 7B model using SageMaker Jumpstart\n",
    "* We learned to interact with our model using the SageMaker SDK\n",
    "* We used LangChains `PromptTemplate` module to define our prompt template, which includes table information and few shot examples.\n",
    "* We explored LangChains `create_sql_query_chain` module, to generate an SQL query\n",
    "* We connected all these components including the execution of the query on our database.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can adapt this notebook and also the application to your data by connecting it to your database and using few-shot examples specific to your data. This notebook contains static few-shot examples. For a larger corpus of data, it might make sense to consider [including dynamic few-shot examples](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/qa_structured/sql#including-dynamic-few-shot-examples). Furthermore, the table information can also be dynamic for every question, eliminating the need of including all the tables. For this, you can take a look at [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/jumpstart-foundation-models-customize-rag.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "While this notebook contains a simple workflow on how to build a Natural Language to SQL demo, for a deeper dive, please refer to [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15363.pdf) benchmark evaluation on this use case, including Supervised Fine Tuning for Text-to-SQL. If you want to explore how to build applications around our use case and operationalize everything, see [here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/fmops-llmops-operationalize-generative-ai-and-differences-with-mlops/).\n"
